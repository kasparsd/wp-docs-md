# FAQ Installation <a name="documentation/article/faq-installation" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-installation/

## Installation

### How do I install WordPress?

Under most circumstances, installing WordPress is a very simple process and takes less than five minutes to complete. Many web hosts offer tools to automatically install WordPress for you. If you prefer a manual installation you can take a look at the [Installation Guide](/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/).

### How do I find a good host for my WordPress website?

Any host that supports the [requirements for WordPress](#about/requirements) can be used for hosting your website. If youâre not sure if your host can run WordPress the best thing to do would be to contact them and ask if they meet the requirements for running WordPress. You can find a list with some good hosts [here](#hosting).

### How do I install using cPanel / cPanel X?

If you want to perform a manual installation using cPanel you can follow the guide on [using cPanel](/support/article/using-cpanel/).

### How do I configure the wp-config.php file?

The wp-config.php file is one of the most important files of your website. Itâs located in the root of your WordPress installation and contains most of the websiteâs configuration details. Editing this file can be done in any plain-text editor. Usually this isnât necessary unless youâre installing WordPress manually.  
See also:

- [Editing wp-config.php](/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/)

### What are the requirements for installing WordPress?

The current requirements for running WordPress can be found on the [requirements page at WordPress.org](#about/requirements).

### How do I get WordPress to use my language?

If you want to change the language that WordPress is using, you can select your preferred language in the [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/). To do this you can go the [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) &gt; [General](/support/article/settings-general-screen/), and choose your preferred language from Site Language dropdown menu.

### Do I need to create a database?

Yes. WordPress requires access to a [MySQL ](https://www.mysql.com/) or [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) database to store information. So youâll need a database.  
You should create a new database if:

1. You have not already created one on the server
2. Your generous host offers you more than one database, and you wish to have a separate database for the website you are setting up.

It is not essential to create a new database for each WordPress installation.

- If you are using the same database for multiple WordPress installations, take care to edit the [wp-](/advanced-topics/editing-wp-config-php/)[config.php](/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/) file ensuring that each installation has a unique database prefix.
- If you are setting up a new database for a new website, edit [wp-](/advanced-topics/editing-wp-config-php/)[config.php](/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/), and be sure to get the database name, and other details correct.

- [Installation, Detailed Instructions](/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/#detailed-instructions)

### Why is my website showing a 403 Error?

If the following (or similar) message appears after uploading your website a couple of things can be happening:

> You are not authorized to view this page. You might not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials you supplied. If you believe you should be able to view this directory or page, please try to contact the Web site by using any e-mail address or phone number that may be listed on the personal.fredsmith.com home page. You can click Search to look for information on the Internet. HTTP Error 403 â Forbidden

If your account is hosted on a Apache based server the following things can be happening:

- server permissions arenât allowing the request from being executed
- your index.php isnât configured to be an allowed directory index
- the underlying filesystem isnât allowing Apache access to the files requested

If you have checked all these settings and everything seems to be set up correctly youâd best contact your hosting provider for support.

### Can I rename the WordPress folder?

If you have **not already installed** WordPress, you can rename the folder with the WordPress files, before, or even after uploading the files.

If you have WordPress **installed already**, and you want to rename the folder, login to your website as an administrator and change the following settings in [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) &gt; [General](/support/article/settings-general-screen/):

- WordPress Address (URL):
- Site Address (URL):

Once you have done this, you can rename the directory or folder with the WordPress files in it.

- [Moving WordPress](/support/article/moving-wordpress/)

### Why is my upload directory âC:apachehtdocswordpressâ?

When you specified the upload path, you used backslashes.

Use forward slashes â/â to specify the path to the directory.

### Can I install WordPress on Windows Server?

Yes you can! As long as you have PHP installed you shouldnât have any trouble getting started with WordPress. Both Apache and Microsoft IIS are capable of serving your WordPress website.

## Advanced Installation

### How do I install WordPress with the files in different directories?

This also answers the questions:

- How can I have my blog in one folder but my index at root?
- How can I have people see my blog at www.example.com but keep all the files in `www.example.com/wordpress`?
- How do I install WordPress in a different directory than where the index.php resides?

- [Moving WordPress](/support/article/moving-wordpress/)

### How can I hide my blog from people?

Whether you are testing a new version of WordPress, setting up a new blog or have some other reason to limit access, the following information may help you keep unwanted visitors out.

**Apache**

There is no guaranteed way to do this. You can use the **.htaccess** file (which also contains your permalink code) to check for certain IP addresses and prevent them from viewing your site. This will only stop the IP address, not the person, so if they have access to an allowed IP address, they can get to your page. One tutorial for this is located at [Clockwatchers.com](http://www.clockwatchers.com/htaccess_intro.html)

An **.htaccess** file can also be used to prevent others from âhot-linkingâ to your images (bandwidth theft) or to set up a password protected blog.

**Apache Basic Authentication**

To require a password to access your site using **.htaccess** and **.htpasswd**.

Tools that help you create the files necessary to password protect your site: [Htpasswd generator](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/), [htaccess Tools](http://makeawebsitehub.com/htaccess-generator/) and [ Clockwatchers.com .htaccess And .htpasswd Tools](http://www.clockwatchers.com/htaccess_tool.html)

*Note:* When your site is accessed the password is encoded weakly using Base64 and can be easily intercepted and decoded.

**Search Engines: Spiders and Bots**

Search Engines will index your site and cache your content. If you do not want this to happen, you can go to the Settings &gt; Reading from Administration Screen, and Click Check the âDiscourage search engines from indexing this siteâ box to ask search engines not to index this site.  
Note: It is up to search engines to honor your request.  
You may use a file called **robots.txt**. More details can be found at [ Affilorama.com](http://www.affilorama.com/site-building/robots-txt) and elsewhere on the web.

### How can I solve login problems?

See also:

- [Login Trouble](/support/article/login-trouble/)

### How can I get WordPress working when Iâm behind a reverse proxy?

In some setups, itâs necessary to use something other than the HTTP\_HOST header to generate URLs. Reverse proxies take the original request and send it to one of a group of servers. To do so, it overwrites the HTTP\_HOST with the internal serverâs domain. When that domain is not publicly accessible, at best your images might not load correctly, at worst, youâll be stuck in a redirect loop. To fix this, figure out which header has the right domain name and add a line to your wp-config.php file that overwrites HTTP\_HOST with the correct hostname.

If you need to use SERVER\_NAME, add this line to wp-config.php:

```
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] = $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
```

If you need to use HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_HOST, add this line to wp-config.php:

```
$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST'];
```

## MySQL or MariaDB

### Do I really need MySQL/MariaDB?

Yes. You certainly need the [MySQL](/support/article/glossary/#mysql) or [MariaDB](/support/article/glossary/#mariadb) database servers to power your WordPress blog. In fact, WordPress only supports the [MySQL](/support/article/glossary/#mysql) and [MariaDB](/support/article/glossary/#mariadb) database servers.  
See also:

- [Requirements for WordPress](#about/requirements)

### Can I use a database other than MySQL/MariaDB?

No. Other databases are not supported at the moment.

There are several other excellent database storage engines, such as PostgreSQL and SQLite that WordPress is interested in supporting in the future. Supporting multiple databases is trickier than it sounds and is not under active development, although there are plenty of architectural discussions about the best approach to take. Approaches for increasing the number of supported databases are discussed at [Using Alternative Databases](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Using Alternative Databases>).

### Why does WordPress use MySQL/MariaDB?

[MySQL](/support/article/glossary/#mysql) and [MariaDB](/support/article/glossary/#mariadb) are extremely fast. It is also the most widely available database server in the world. Open-source and free, [MySQL](/support/article/glossary/#mysql) and [MariaDB](/support/article/glossary/#mariadb) are supported by thousands of low-cost [Linux](/support/article/glossary/#linux) (and Windows!) hosts, which means a very low barrier to entry for anyone wanting to start a WordPress (or database-driven) website. [MySQLâs documentation](http://www.mysql.com/documentation/) is useful, cogent and thorough. (Note: it may be intimidating if you are new to all this.) Add to all that the fact that users are able to directly manipulate [MySQL](/support/article/glossary/#mysql) and [MariaDB](/support/article/glossary/#mariadb) with [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/), developed expressly for that purpose, and it is obvious that [MySQL](/support/article/glossary/#mysql) and [MariaDB](/support/article/glossary/#mariadb) are the best choice.

## PHP

### What is phpMyAdmin?

phpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL/MariaDB over the Web.

See also:

- [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/)

### Do I need to know PHP to use WordPress ?

No. The only time you would modify your WordPress blog with [PHP](/support/article/glossary/#php) would be when integrating some of the [plugins](/support/article/plugins/). In most cases clear instructions are given within a text file that accompanies the [plugin](/support/article/plugins/). Other than that, you will not be changing any of the PHP files.

### Will WordPress run in PHP Safe Mode?

Most definitely! There are no known issues with any version of WordPress when [PHP](/support/article/glossary/#php) is running in Safe Mode.

### Do I really need PHP?

Yes. You certainly need [PHP](/support/article/glossary/#php) to power your WordPress blog. [PHP](/support/article/glossary/#php) is the scripting language that drives all of WordPress, and without [PHP](/support/article/glossary/#php), your server will not be able to interpret the pages that create your weblog. For supported PHP version, refer [Requirements for WordPress](#about/requirements).

### How do I find out which version of PHP I have?

To get information about your server, you can use the [*phpinfo()*](http://php.net/phpinfo) function. This will also give you information about your [Apache](/support/article/glossary/#apache) and [PHP](/support/article/glossary/#php) version and [ mod\_rewrite](/support/article/glossary/#mod_rewrite).

# First steps with WordPress (Classic Editor) <a name="documentation/article/first-steps-with-wordpress-classic" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/first-steps-with-wordpress-classic/

Note: This page refers to WordPress using the older or Classic Editor. If you are on a new version of WordPress or using the block editor, refer to [this page](#documentation/article/first-steps-with-wordpress-block-editor).

## I have done the 5-minute installation. Now what?

Youâve just completed the [5-Minute Installation](/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/) of WordPress or the one-click install from your web host. So what is your next step?

Letâs take a step-by-step tour through your WordPress site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please *donât change anything within the program* unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, youâll soon be changing everything.

### Log In

![Login screen for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/login_form.png)  
Begin by logging in to the administration area, or the [back end](/support/article/glossary/#back-end), of your website. Visit your siteâs login page by placing *wp-admin* after your domain name (e.g., http://example.com/wp-admin). Some [themes](/support/article/using-themes/) provide a login link or form on the [front end](/support/article/glossary/#front-end) as well. Now log in to WordPress using the username and password you created in the 5-minute install.

### Start at the Top

![Dashboard â¹ Your Website â WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-â¹-Your-Website-â-WordPress.png)After logging in you are on the main [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/) called the [Dashboard](/support/article/glossary/#dashboard). This is where the organization of your site begins.

At the top of the screen is the area called the [*toolbar*](/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together). Click on your site name; itâs a link and it will take you to a view of your new WordPress site. Like it? Donât like it? Doesnât matter, just look at it. This is where you are going to be spending a lot of time!

## Test Drive Your WordPress Site

Take time to look at the site before you get into changing it and figuring out [how it all works](https://codex.wordpress.org/Working_with_WordPress); itâs important to see how the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme is laid out and how it works. Consider this the test drive before you start adding all the special features.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/localhost_8080_wpdev_Laptop-with-HiDPI-screen-1024x997.png)The layout you are looking at is defined by a [WordPress Theme](/support/article/using-themes/). It is the [appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) of your website, styling the look of the site and the framing of the content. The WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme features a âheaderâ at the top with the title and tagline for your site. Below this is your [Menu](/support/article/appearance-menus-screen/), if you have one. Along the side you will see some titles and links. This is the Sidebar. The different items inside a Sidebar are called [Widgets](/support/article/wordpress-widgets/). The main middle section of the page is the content area.

Scroll down the page and notice the bar at the end of the page. This is called the âfooter.â It says âProudly powered by WordPress.â

Back to the sidebar, you will see different sections with information. Among these you may find a list of Recent Posts, Recent Comments, Archives, [Categories](/support/article/administration-screens/#categories), links to the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/), Log Out, and RSS feeds. This is part of the menu or navigation Screen that people will use to move around your site, visiting posts from different categories or time periods.

### Take a Quick Trip Around

For now you only have one post. It is residing within a page that is laid out as your *home page* or the front page. If you click on the title of the post, it will take you to the specific page for that post. The first page or home page of your site features the most recent posts on your site. Each post title will link to the actual page of the post. Some Theme designers design their *single* post pages to look different from the home page.

In the single post, pay attention to the layout and notice what is different about the design elements. Is the header different? Smaller, larger, or a different color? Is there a sidebar?

All of these changes are created from a few files called [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/). You can learn more about how they work in [Theme Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/). For now, however, letâs get on with how the rest of WordPress works.

## Test Drive the WordPress Administration Screens

Now that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, itâs time to test drive the [WordPress Administration](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administering_Your_Blog). This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the [Dashboard](/support/article/glossary/#dashboard), a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.

![Dashboard â¹ Your Website â WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Dashboard-â¹-Your-Website-â-WordPress.png)The [Dashboard](/support/article/glossary/#dashboard) features a list of the most recent activity youâve accomplished on your site and it helps to keep you up to date on new and interesting bits of information from the many WordPress resources.

On the left side of the screen is the **main navigation** menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will âfly outâ for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a âparentâ navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section.

The various menu items are as follows:

- [Dashboard](/support/article/administration-screens/#dashboard-information-central)
- [Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content)
- [Media](/support/article/administration-screens/#media-add-pictures-and-movies-to-your-posts)
- [Pages](/support/article/administration-screens/#pages-your-static-content)
- [Comments](/support/article/administration-screens/#comments-reader-feedback)
- [Appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog)
- [Plugins](/support/article/administration-screens/#plugins-add-functionality-to-your-blog)
- [Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#users-your-blogging-family)
- [Tools](/support/article/administration-screens/#tools-managing-your-blog)
- [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings)

### Letâs start with the User screen

Click on the **Users** tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called [All Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#all-users) that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authors accounts. In the navigation menu, click on the [Your Profile](/support/article/administration-screens/#your-profile) menu choice. This is where you will enter information about you, the author and [administrator](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator) of the site. Fill in the information and click **Update Profile** when done.

![Profile â¹ Your Website â WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Profile-â¹-Your-Website-â-WordPress.png)Now, letâs look at some other powerful features of the WordPress Admin.

### Changing the Look

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/localhost_8080_wordpress_wp-admin_themes.phpLaptop-with-HiDPI-screen-1024x640.png)  
 The [Appearance, Themes Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) allows you to change the look of your site using different [Themes](/support/article/using-themes/). Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from. In your Appearance Screen, you will see a list of currently installed themes, including the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme. To quickly change the theme, simply click on the Activate button under one of the themes listed, then click on your site name in the top [toolbar](/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together) to see how it looks. Wow, you have another look. Itâs that easy. Go back to **Appearance &gt; Theme** and click the Activate button under the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme to bring the design back to what you had. To see it again, click your site name in the toolbar, and there it is.

### Creating a post

Back in the [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/), take a look at the [Posts Screen](/support/article/administration-screens#all-posts). You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to [write and manage your posts](/support/article/writing-posts/). Letâs start by making your first test post in the [Add New](/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content) tab.

![Add a New Post â¹ Your Website â WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/Add-a-New-Post-â¹-Your-Website-â-WordPress.png)Simply fill in the blanks, one by one, in the post beginning with the title and then write a little test message in the post window. This is just for a test, so you can write anything you want. When you are done, click the **Publish** button that is to the right of the post entry window and it is done. Thereâs more exciting work ahead! Now that youâve gotten a feel for writing posts, you can view your posts by clicking your site name in the [toolbar](/support/article/administration-screens#toolbar) at top of the screen.

### Comments

Part of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. Do you want comments on your posts? Comments on posts come in a variety of forms, from *pats on the back* (*Good job! Like the post!*) to extensive conversations and commentary about the posts. Or maybe you are seeking comments that add to the information youâve posted. Responding to comments and [moderating them](/support/article/comments-in-wordpress/) can also take up a lot of time. If they are critical to your site, then include them and consider how you want them presented. You can make a few comments yourself on the post you created. Take a look at how they are laid out and consider how you might want them to look to fit into the design and layout of your site. When you have reached your decision about how you want to handle comments, take time to read through the [article on comments and WordPress discussion options](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) to help you set those features.

### Preventing Spam

There is more to think about when it comes to having comments on your site. Unfortunately we live in a world where [spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam) is a fact of life. It is recommended that you begin battling the comment spammers with the helpful article, [Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam).

### Create Categories

Posts are usually stored in Categories and/or Tags so you can keep related topics together. Right now you only have one category, but that will soon want more. In the **[Posts &gt; Categories](/support/article/administration-screens/#categories)** tab, in the **Add New Category** area, fill in the information about your category. Continue to add your *parent* categories, going down the list. Hold off on entering subcategories until all the main categories are entered.

> **NOTE:***You can add any new category at any time, but make a note of the fact that categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult to change this, so if you donât want your categories sorted alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them presented on the screen.*

## Setting Up Your Site

Before you get to the graphic look of your site, letâs do a little more administration to your site to set it up. You may want to install plugins to supercharge your website, and donât forget to activate the [Akismet WordPress Plugin](#plugins/akismet) that is available with all WordPress sites to help protect it from comment spam. When you have the parent categories entered, enter your subcategories. In the pull down menu for Parent Category, you can select the *parent* to the subcategory you are adding. When you view your categories in the Manage &gt; Categories Screen, you will see the categories listed like this:

- Computer Tips 
    - Windows
    - Linux
    - Mac
- Internet News
- Web Page Design 
    - Web Standards
- WordPress 
    - Plugins
    - Themes

### Put Posts in Categories

Letâs put some of your test posts into categories so you can see how this works. From the **Posts &gt; Category Screen**, click on the tab for **[All Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#all-posts)**. You should see the test posts you entered here. When you hover your mouse over each post title, under the title, you should see the **Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View** links. Click on **Edit** to edit one of the posts. On the right side of the Edit Post screen you will now see your **Categories**. Choose one of them by clicking in the box next to it. Then in the Publish module above, click the **Update** button. Repeat this for your other test posts, putting each one in a different category. Now view your page by clicking on your site name in the [toolbar](/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together) at the top of your [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/). Do you see the categories listed in the sidebar now? Great. If you are missing a category, that usually means that there are no posts in it. This is the default function of WordPress, so not to worry. When you add a post to the âmissingâ category, it will appear on your web pages. Click on one of the categories and you will be taken to a page for just that category. You should see the posts that went into that category. This is a generated *Category* page. Now, click on the **Archives** for the month showing. Now you are visiting a generated page of your posts listed in chronological order for this month â well, specifically for today only. Two methods of finding the same information.

### What Is Next

Youâve now done all the basics for your new WordPress website. You know how to write a post, create a category, and how to view your siteâs information by category and archive. You can start the customization process, and when you are done, donât forget to delete your test posts! Then start writing some wonderful information to share with your new-found public!

## Using WordPress Themes

There are hundreds of [WordPress Themes](/support/article/using-themes/) to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audienceâs needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above. Click through the whole site, the categories and archives as well as the individual posts to see how the Theme handles each one. The look may be nice on the front page, but if it handles things in a way you donât like on the single post, then you will have to dig into the code and make changes. Not ready for that, try another theme.

- [WordPress Theme Directory](#themes)
- [Using Theme](/support/article/using-themes/)

### Creating your own Theme

If you are familiar with CSS, HTML, and even PHP and MySQL, consider either customizing the Theme to your own needs, or creating your own Theme.

- [WordPress Theme Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/)

## Using WordPress Plugins

![Plugin screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/plugin-panel.png)[WordPress Plugins](/support/article/plugins/) are also known as add-ons or extensions. They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. They cover the gamut from up-to-date weather reports to simple organization of your posts and categories. Plugins are designed by volunteer contributors and enthusiasts who like challenges and problem solving. They are usually fairly [simple to install](/support/article/managing-plugins/) through the WordPress Admin Plugin Screen, just follow the instructions provided by the plugin author. Remember, these are free and non-essential. If you have any problems with plugins, contact the plugin authorâs website or plugin source first, then search the Internet for help with that specific plugin, and if you havenât found a solution, then visit the WordPress forums for more help.

- [Managing Plugins](/support/article/managing-plugins/)

### Creating your own Plugin

If you are familiar with PHP, HTML, and maybe even MySQL, you may be able to customize WordPress to work the way you want by creating your own Plugin.

- [WordPress Plugin Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/)

## Above and Beyond the Basics

The exciting thing about WordPress is that there are few limits. Thousands of people are using WordPress for blogging and for running their websites. For example, look at some of the entries under the [WordPress.org Theme Showcase](#showcase). All have a different look and different functions on their sites. What you do from here is up to you, but here are a few places to take that first step beyond the basics:

# Write posts (Classic Editor) <a name="documentation/article/write-posts-classic-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/write-posts-classic-editor/

**Note**: In December 2018, WordPress 5.0 launched with a new editor. This article was written for the long-available editing experience in prior WordPress versions, which can be used in WordPress 5.0 and up via the [Classic Editor Plugin](#plugins/classic-editor). You may be interested in [user documentation for the new block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).

Posts are entries that display in reverse order on your home page and/or blog page. Posts usually have comment fields beneath them and are included in your siteâs RSS feed.

To write a post:

1. Log in to your WordPress Administration Screen (Dashboard).
2. Click the âPostsâ tab.
3. Click the âAdd Newâ sub-tab.
4. Start filling in the blanks: enter your post title in the upper field, and enter your post body content in the main post editing box below it.
5. As needed, select a category, add tags, and make other selections from the sections below the post. (Each of these sections is explained below.)
6. When you are ready, click **Publish**.

## Screen Options

There are more editing fields available to you than you see on first login. The Screen Options area allows you to choose which Post Fields are displayed or hidden from your editing area, which allows you to minimize clutter and customize according to your needs.

Youâll find the Screen Options tab at the very top of your screen, and if you click on it, youâll see a list of available editing boxes that you can use. Check the box for each Post Field you want displayed, or uncheck the box to hide that module. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the tab.

Once youâve customized how editing screen, your options are saved so you donât have to select or hide them again next time you log in.

## Post Field Descriptions

[![Adding a new post in the classic editor.](#support/files/2018/10/add-new-post.png)](#support/files/2018/10/add-new-post.png)Classic Editor â Top of Page

**Title/Headline Box**

This box should contain the title of your post. You can use any phrase, words, or characters. (Avoid using the same title on more than one page.) You can use commas, apostrophes, quotes, hyphens/dashes, and other typical symbols in the post like âMy Site â Hereâs Lookinâ at You, Kid.â WordPress will then clean it up to generate a user-friendly and URL-valid name of the post (also called the âpost slugâ) to create the permalink for the post.

**Permalink**

Permalink stands for âpermanent link.â That means a post URL that does not expose the post ID which could be subject to a change (e.g. when moving to different blogging system), but it rather contains a user-friendly post name derived from the post title which could also change, although not recommended, but in a more controllable way. This post name (also referred to as âpost slugâ or just âslugâ) can be edited, depending on your [Permalinks](#documentation/article/using-permalinks) settings, using the âEditâ button. (To change your settings, go to Administration Screens &gt; Settings &gt; Permalinks). The permalink is automatically generated based on the title you set to the post and is shown below the title field. Punctuation such as commas, quotes, apostrophes, and invalid URL characters are removed and spaces are substituted with dashes to separate each word. If your title is âMy Site â Hereâs Lookinâ at You, Kidâ, it will be cleaned up to create the slug âmy-site-heres-lookin-at-you-kidâ. You can manually change this, maybe shortening it to âmy-site-lookin-at-you-kidâ.

**Body Copy Box**

The blank box where you enter your writing, links, images, links to images, and any information you want to display on your site. You can use either the visual (WYSIWYG) editor or the text view to compose your posts. For more on the text view, see the section below, [Visual Versus Text Editor](/support/article/writing-posts/#visual-versus-text-editor).

**Publish Box**

Contains buttons that control the state of your post. The main states are Draft and Published. *Draft* means the post has not been published and remains in draft status for the post creator. A *Published* status means the post has been published and is live on your site.

*Preview Button* Allows you to view the post before publishing.

*Save Draft*  
 Allows you to save your post as a draft rather than immediately publishing it. To return to your drafts later, visit Posts â Edit in the menu bar, then select your post from the list.

*Status*  
 If you select a specific publish status (click *Edit* next to *Status:Draft*) and click the update post or âPublishâ button, that status is applied to the post. For example, to save a post in the *Pending Review* status, select Pending Review from the Publish Status drop-down box, and click Save As Pending. (You will see all posts organized by status by going to Administration Screens &gt; Posts &gt; Edit).

*Visibility*  
 This determines how your post appears to the world. (click *Edit* next to *Visibility*) Public posts will be visible by all website visitors once published. Password Protected posts are published to all, but visitors must know the password to view the post content. Private posts are visible only to you (and to other editors or admins within your site).

*Revisions*  
 Click *Browse* to see all of the changes youâve made to your post.

*Scheduling*  
 To schedule a post for publication on a future time or date, click *Edit* next to the words âPublish immediately.â You can also change the publish date to a date in the past to back-date posts. Change the settings to the desired time and date. You must also click the *Publish* button when you have completed the post to publish at the desired time and date.

**Format Box**

Allows you to choose a format for a post. Styling and appearance are handled by the individual themes.

**Categories Box**

The general topic of the post. It is typical for a blog to have 7-10 categories for content. Readers can browse specific categories to see all posts in the category. You can manage your categories by going to Administration Screens &gt; Posts &gt; Categories.

**Tags Box**

These are micro-categories for the post, similar to including index entries for a page. Posts with similar tags are linked together when a user clicks one of the tags. Tags have to be enabled with the right code in your theme for them to appear in your post. Add new tags to the post by typing the tag into the box and clicking âAdd.â You can also click on the âChoose from the most-used tagsâ link to see all of the tags used by the site.

**Excerpt**

A summary or brief teaser of your post that may appear on the front page of your site as well as on the category, archives, and search non-single post pages. Note: the Excerpt does not usually appear by default. It only appears in your post if you have modified the template file listing the post to use the\_excerpt() instead of the\_content() to display the Excerpt instead of the full content of a post. If so, WordPress will automatically use as the Excerpt the first 55 words of your post content or the content before the &lt;!âmoreâ&gt; quicktag. If you use the âExcerptâ field when editing the post, this will be used no matter what. For more information, see Excerpt.

**Send Trackbacks**

A way to notify legacy blog systems that youâve linked to them. If you link other WordPress blogs, theyâll be notified automatically using pingbacks. No other action is necessary. For those blogs that donât recognize pingbacks, you can send a trackback to the blog by entering the website address(es) in this box, separating each one by a space. See Trackbacks and Pingbacks for more information.

**Custom Fields**

Custom Fields offer a way to add information to your site. In conjunction with extra code in your template files or plugins, Custom Fields can modify the way a post is displayed. These are primarily used by plugins, but you can manually edit that information in this section.

**Discussion**

Options to enable interactivity and notification of your posts. This section hosts two check boxes: *Allow Comments on this post* and *Allow trackbacks and pingbacks on this post*.

**Note:** You can set basic options for writing, such as the size of the post box, how smiley tags are converted, and other details by going to Administration Screens &gt; Settings &gt; Writing.

## Best Practices For Posting

You can say or show the world anything you like on your WordPress site. Here are some tips you need to know to help you write your posts in WordPress.

**Practice Accessibility**

To be compliant with web standards for accessibility, be sure to include ALT and TITLE descriptions on links and images to help your users, such as &lt;a title=âWordPress.ORGâ href=â[https://wordpress.org/](https://wordpress.org)â&gt;WordPress.ORG&lt;/a&gt;.

**Use Paragraphs**

No one likes to read writing that never pauses for a line break. To break your writing up into paragraphs, use double spaces between your paragraphs. WordPress will automatically detect these and insert &lt;p&gt; HTML paragraph tags into your writing.

**Use Headings**

If you are writing long posts, break up the sections by using headings, small titles to highlight a change of subject. In HTML, headings are set by the use of h1, h2, h3, h4, and so on.

**Use HTML**

You donât have to use HTML when writing your posts. WordPress will automatically add it to your site, but if you do want control over different elements like boxes, headings, and other additional containers or elements, use HTML.

**Spell Check and Proofread**

There are spell check Plugins available, but even those canât check for everything. Some serious writers will write their posts in a text editor with spell check, check all the spelling and proof it thoroughly before copying and pasting into WordPress.

## Visual Versus Text Editor

When writing your post, you have the option of using the Visual or Text mode of the editor. The visual mode lets you see your post as is, while the Text mode shows you the code and replaces the WYSIWYG editor buttons with quicktags. These quicktags are explained as follows.

- **b** â `<strong></strong>` HTML tag for strong emphasis of text (i.e. **b**old).
- *i* â `<em></em>` HTML tag for emphasis of text (i.e. *i*talicize).
- b-quote â `<blockquote></blockquote>` HTML tag to distinguish quoted or cited text.
- del â `<del></del>` HTML tag to label text considered deleted from a post. Most browsers display as striked through text.
- link â `<a href="http://example.com"></a>` HTML tag to create a hyperlink.
- ins â `<ins></ins>` HTML tag to label text considered inserted into a post. Most browsers display as underlined text.
- ul â `<ul></ul>` HTML tag will insert an unordered list, or wrap the selected text in same. An unordered list will typically be a bulleted list of items.
- ol â `<ol></ol>` HTML tag will insert a numbered list, or wrap the selected text in same. Each item in an ordered list is typically numbered.
- li â `<li></li>` HTML tag will insert or make the selected text a list item. Used in conjunction with the ul or ol tag.
- code â `` HTML tag for preformatted styling of text. Generally sets text in a `monospaced font, such as Courier`.
- more â `<!--more-->` WordPress tag that breaks a post into âteaserâ and content sections. Type a few paragraphs, insert this tag, then compose the rest of your post. On your blogâs home page youâll see only those first paragraphs with a hyperlink (`(more...)`), which when followed displays the rest of the postâs content.
- page â `<!--nextpage-->` WordPress tag similar to the `more` tag, except it can be used any number of times in a post, and each insert will âbreakâ and paginate the post at that location. Hyperlinks to the paginated sections of the post are then generated in combination with the wp\_link\_pages() or link\_pages() template tag.
- lookup â Opens a JavaScript dialogue box that prompts for a word to search for through the online dictionary at answers.com. You can use this to check spelling on individual words.
- Close Tags â Closes any open HTML tags left openâbut pay attention to the closing tags. WordPress is not a mind reader (!), so make sure the tags enclose what you want, and in the proper way.

***Workflow Note*** â With Quicktag buttons that insert HTML tags, you can for example click *i* to insert the opening `<em>` tag, type the text to be enclosed, and click */i* or Close Tags to insert the closing tag. However, you can eliminate the need for this âcloseâ step by changing your workflow a bit: type your text, select the portion to be emphasized (that is, italicized), then click *i* and your highlighted text will be wrapped in the opening and closing tags.

# Create pages <a name="documentation/article/create-pages" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-pages/

In WordPress, you can put content on your site as either a *Post* or a *Page*.

When youâre writing a regular blog entry, you write a *Post*. *Posts*, in a default setup, appear in reverse chronological order on your blogâs home page.

In contrast, *Pages* are for non-chronological content. *Pages* live outside of the normal blog chronology and are often used to present timeless information about yourself or your site â information that is always relevant.

You can use *Pages* to organize and manage the structure of your website content. You can add as many pages to your site as you would like, and you can update your pages as many times as you want.

After you create a page, you can add it to your siteâs navigation menu so your visitors can find it.

Here are a few examples for *Pages*:

- About
- Contact
- Privacy Policy
- Copyright
- Disclosure
- Legal Information
- Reprint Permissions
- Company Information
- Accessibility Statement

In general, *Pages* are very similar to *Posts* in that they both have titles and content. WordPress Theme template files maintain a consistent look throughout your site. *Pages*, though, have several key distinctions that make them different from *Posts*.

**What Pages are**

- *Pages* are for content that isnât time-dependent, or which is not part of the blog content.
- *Pages* can be organized into parent pages and subpages.
- *Pages* can use different page templates, including template files, and Template Tags.
- Some themes may provide different display options for individual *Pages*.
- You can have a WordPress website with only *Pages*.

**What Pages are not**

- *Pages* donât appear in the chronological view in the blog of a website.
- *Pages* by default do not allow taxonomy (categories, tags, and any custom taxonomies). You can enhance it via plugins.
- *Pages* are not files. They are stored in your database, just like *Posts*.
- *Pages* are not included in your siteâs feeds. (e.g. RSS or Atom.)
- *Pages* and *Posts* can be interpreted differently by site visitors and by search engines. Search engines place more relevance on *Posts* because a newer post on a topic may be more relevant than a static page.
- A specific *page* (or a specific *post*) can be set as a [static front page](/support/article/creating-a-static-front-page/). Websites that are set up this way have a blog page that displays the latest blog posts.

## Pages screen

To view all the Pages in your site:

- Log in to your [WordPress admin screen](#documentation/article/administration-screens).
- Click **Pages** in the left sidebar. This will show the Pages screen with a list of all the pages you have in your site.

![The Pages screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-3.45.58-PM-1024x497.png)1. You can easily search for a *Page* based on the Page Title.
2. You can get a list of all the Published *Pages* or Draft *Pages*.
3. You can filter *Pages* based on dates.
4. You can perform **Bulk actions** &gt; **Edit** or **Move to Trash** by selecting multiple *Pages* from the list.
5. You can sort the *Pages* list based on Title, Date, Author etc by clicking the Header columns.

## Organizing Pages

You can organize your *Pages* into parent and child pages and create a hierarchy.

For example, you can have an About Page as a parent page and create subpages under it for Careers, Board of Directors, Locations, Company Culture, Press etc. You can also have a Services Page as a parent page and create subpages for each of the services such as Web Design, Web Development, Stationery Design etc

The structure of the pages on the site would then look like this.

- About Us 
    - Board of Directors
    - Company Culture
    - Press
    
    
    - Careers
    - Locations
- Services 
    - Web Design
    - Web Development
    - Stationery Design

## Creating a new Page

To create a new *Page*:

1. Log in to your [WordPress admin screen](#documentation/article/administration-screens).
2. Click the **Pages** &gt; **Add New** in the left sidebar.
3. Alternatively, you can also click the *Add New* button in the Pages screen.

![Two ways to add a new page from the WordPress administration screen.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-10.05.11-AM-2-1024x694.png)4. Add a title for the page.
5. Add body content for the page. If you are using the [WordPress block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor), you can use the different [blocks ](#documentation/article/blocks)available in the WordPress block editor to design the Page.
6. Customize the [sidebar settings](#documentation/article/settings-sidebar) for the page.
7. When the page is completed, click *Publish*.

![New page screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-3.02.24-PM-1024x635.png)If you are using a classic editor, refer to this support article for details about the [Add new screen in the Classic editor](#documentation/article/pages-add-new-screen).

### Creating a subpage

Using Parent Pages is a good way to organize your siteâs *Pages* into hierarchies. A parent page is a top-level page, with sub pages nested under it.

To create a subpage under a parent page:

1. Log in to your [WordPress admin screen](#documentation/article/administration-screens).
2. Click the **Pages** &gt; **Add New** in the left sidebar. Alternatively, you can also click the *Add New* button in the Pages screen.
3. In the [sidebar settings](#documentation/article/settings-sidebar) for the page, under ***Page Attributes*,** open the *Parent Page* drop-down menu. This will list all the *Pages* already created in your site.

![Creating sub pages under Parent page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-3.21.34-PM-1024x582.png)4. Select the desired page from the drop-down menu that you want to be the parent page for the current you are creating. The current page you are creating now becomes the sub page for the parent page you choose.

![Creating sub pages Board of Directors under Parent page About Us](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-3.29.08-PM-1024x625.png)5. You can change the order that your pages are displayed when using a default menu, by using the Order field of the Page Attributes module. Put the number **1** in the box for Order. This tells WordPress to display this page first on your site.
6. Add a title for the sub page.
7. Add body content for the sub page.
8. Click *Publish* when ready.

Repeat the process for your other sub pages you want to be disapled under a Parent page, but use higher numbers for the Order field: 2, 3, etc. This tells WordPress to display these pages second and third on your site.

When your *Pages* are [listed](#creating-a-list-of-pages), the child *Page* will be nested under the parent *Page*. The [Permalinks](/support/article/using-permalinks/) of your *Pages* will also reflect this page hierarchy. In the above example, the [Permalink](/support/article/using-permalinks/) for the Board of Directors Page would be:

```
http://example.com/about/board-of-directors/
```

## Changing the URL of a Page

### Using the Edit option

To change the URL (also referred to as âslugâ) containing the name of your Page, hover over the Page title of the Page in the [Pages screen](#pages-screen) and select *Edit*.

![Edit button in the Pages screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-4.00.09-PM.png)In the [Page Sidebar settings](#documentation/article/settings-sidebar), under *Summary* click the URL link to open the URL popup. Change the Permalink entry to change the URL of the page.

![Changing the Permalink](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-4.04.43-PM-1024x477.png)As you type in a new URL in the *Permalink* field, you can view the updated Page URL under *View Page*.

![Change and View the Permalink updates](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-4.07.20-PM.png)Select *Update* to save the new URL changes.

### Using the Quick Edit option

To change the URL (also referred to as âslugâ) containing the name of your Page, hover over the Page title of the Page in the [Pages screen](#pages-screen) and select *Quick Edit*.

![Quick Edit the Page URL](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-4.09.34-PM.png)This will open a Quick Edit Panel while you are still in the Pages screen. The Quick Edit panel allows you to modify page details such as Title, Slug, Date, Author. You can also Password protect the page or mark the page as Private. You can also change the Parent page, page order, template for the page and the Status of the page between Published, Pending Review and Draft.

![Quick Edit Panel in the Pages screen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-24-at-4.14.28-PM-1024x584.png)Select *Update* button to save the changes.

## Page Templates

A *template* controls the layout of your pages. Not to be confused with Themes (that set the design of your entire site), the *template* affects the look and feel of an individual page (or post) or groups of pages (or posts.)

Individual pages can be set to use a specific [**Page Template**](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/) created within your theme. You can also create [custom Page Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/#creating-custom-page-templates-for-global-use) that can be used for a page. These custom Page Templates will then override the default Page Template included with your Theme.

## The dynamic nature of Pages

A web page can be *static* or *dynamic.*

Static pages, such as a regular HTML page created with Dreamweaver, do not have to be regenerated every time a person visits the page.

An example of a static page might be an [HTML](/support/article/glossary/#html) document (without any [PHP](/support/article/glossary/#php) code). The problem with purely static pages is that they are difficult to maintain.

In contrast, dynamic pages, such as those created with WordPress, need to be regenerated every time they are viewed. The code for what needs to be generated on the page has been specified by the theme author, and not the actual page itself. They use extensive PHP code which is evaluated each time the page is visited, and the entire page is generated upon each new visit.

Almost everything in WordPress is generated dynamically, including **Pages**. Everything published in WordPress (Posts, Pages, Comments, Blogrolls, Categories, etcâ¦) is stored in the [MySQL](/support/article/glossary/#mysql) database. When the site is accessed, the database information is used by your WordPress [Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/) from your current [Theme](/support/article/using-themes/) to generate the web page being requested.

Changes you make to your WordPress settings, Themes, and [Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/) will not be propagated to pages coded only in HTML. The Page feature of WordPress was developed to alleviate this problem. By using Pages, you no longer have to update your static pages every time you change the style of your site. If written properly, your dynamic Pages will update along with the rest of your blog.

Despite the dynamic nature of Pages, many people refer to them as being static. They are actually called âpseudo-staticâ web pages. In other words, a Page contains *static information* but is *generated dynamically*. Thus, either âstatic,â âdynamic,â or âpseudo-staticâ may be validly used to describe the nature of the WordPress Page feature.

# Media Library screen <a name="documentation/article/media-library-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/media-library-screen/

## Media âï¸ Library 

Media consists of the images, video, recordings, and files that you upload and use in your blog. Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when [writing a Post](#documentation/article/write-posts-classic-editor) or [writing a Page](#documentation/article/pages-add-new-screen). Note that the Uploading Setting in the [Settings Media Screen](#documentation/article/settings-media-screen) describes the location and structure of the upload directory (where your media files are stored). If you do need to upload Media, even if that Media is not related to a Post or Page, then you need to use the [Media Add New Screen](#documentation/article/media-add-new-screen).

Visit the [Media add new screen](#documentation/article/media-add-new-screen) to install new media by clicking the Add New link at the top of this screen or Select **[Media](#documentation/article/administration-screens) &gt; [Add New](#documentation/article/media-add-new-screen)** from the left side menu.

### [Media library](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

The Media Library Screen allows you to edit, view, and delete Media previously uploaded to your blog. Multiple Media objects can be selected for deletion. Search and filtering ability is also provided to allow you to find the desired Media.

Media Library provides two type of views. One is simple visual [Grid View](#documentation/article/media-library-screen-grid-view) and another is conventional [List View](#documentation/article/media-library-screen-list-view). Switch between these views using the icons to the left above the screen.

## [Media library grid view](#documentation/article/media-library-screen-grid-view)

In Media Library Grid View, thumbnails of image, Audio icons and Movie icons are arranged in the grid.

![Media items showing in grid view](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/media-library-grid-view-1-1024x518.png)Grid view of media items### [Filtering options](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

At the top of Grid View, you can filter the media by media type and date:

**All media items**

This dropdown allows you to select, by media types such as Images, Audio and Video or Unattached to any Posts nor Pages, which Media are displayed in the Table of Media. By default, âAll media itemsâ are selected and all of your Media are displayed.

**All dates**

This dropdown allows you to select, by date, which Media are displayed in the Grid View. By default, âShow all datesâ is selected and all of your Media are displayed.

To the right, is a Search box where you can enter a word, or series of words to search and display all the Media meeting your search words. The search results will be updated as you type.

### [Delete media](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

To delete media items, click the Bulk Select button at the top of the screen. Select any items you wish to delete, then click the Delete Selected button. Clicking the Cancel Selection button takes you back to viewing your media.

### [Attachment details](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

In Media Library Grid View, clicking an Image thumbnail, Audio icon or Video icon will display an Attachment Details dialog, which allows you to preview media and make quick edits. Any changes you make to the attachment details will be automatically saved. You can also delete individual items and access the extended edit screen from the details dialog.  
Use the arrow buttons at the top of the dialog, or the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard, to navigate between media items quickly.

![Attachment details for individual item showing the download file link ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/attachment-details-1-1024x580.png)Attachment details screenAttachment Details changes its appearance and information by media type. The left side of this dialog shows the Image, Audio player or Video player. The right side lists the following media file attributes and optional data. Some of them are editable from this dialog.

- **Uploaded on** â The date when the media file was uploaded
- **Uploaded by** â [author](#documentation/article/users-screen) who uploaded the Media.
- **Uploaded to** â Title of the Post or Page that contains this Media. Click on the title to view that Post or Page in an edit Screen. If the Media was unattached to any Post or Page, this line does not appear.

**Edit more details**

Displays the Edit Media Screen. See the [Edit Media](#documentation/article/edit-media) for details on editing Media information.

**Download file**

Makes it easier for users to download their uploaded media by providing a download link on the attachment details screen and in the media modal.

**Delete permanently**

Deletes the media.

**Edit image**

(Image files only) Allows you to make edits such as rotate, scale, and crop. See the [Edit Image Screen](#documentation/article/edit-media).

## [Media library list view](#documentation/article/media-library-screen-list-view)

In Media Library List View, a table lists all of your Media, by row. The Media are listed with the newest uploaded Media first.

[![Showing List view for the items inside media library ](#documentation/files/2018/10/medialibrary_listview.png)](#documentation/files/2018/10/medialibrary_listview.png)List view for the items inside media library### [Table of media](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

The table of Media contains the following columns:

- **\[ \]** â This checkbox, when clicked (checked), âselectsâ that particular Media to be processed by a Bulk Action.
- **âthumbnailâ** â There is no column heading for âthumbnailâ, but a small image of the actual media is displayed in this column
- **File** â Displayed in the form of a link, this is Title, the name of the media. Clicking the title link opens Edit Media Screen. See the [Edit Media](#documentation/article/edit-media) for details on editing Media information. Below the Title, the actual name of the file that holds this particular Media is displayed.
- **Author** â Displayed in the form of a link, this is the [author](#documentation/article/users-screen) who uploaded the Media. Clicking the author link causes all the Media authored by that user to be displayed in the Table of Media (thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all Media for a given author).
- **Uploaded to** â Uploaded to describes the title of the Post or Page that contains this Media and the date of that Post or Page. Click on the title to view that Post or Page in an edit Screen. If the Media was unattached to any Post or Page, an âAttachâ link will appear and when clicked this Media can be attached to selected Posts or Pages. For more detail about selecting, see [Find Posts or Pages](#documentation/article/media-library-screen). If the Media has been attached to more than one Post or Page, only the details of the first Post or Page will be displayed.
- **Comment bubble** â Each Media row has a comment bubble with the number of comments for that Media. If a Media has any comments, then the number of comments is displayed in a bubble. Clicking on a blue comment bubble causes the [Comments Screen](#documentation/article/comments-screen) to be displayed to allow moderation of those comments.
- **Date** â The date the Media was uploaded.

#### [Sortable columns](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

Some column headings, such as the **File**, **Author**, **Uploaded to**, and **Date** headings, can be clicked to sort the Table of Media in ascending or descending order. Hover over the column title, e.g. **File**, to see the up arrow or down arrow. Click the heading to change the sort order.

#### [Page navigation](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

Under the Screen Options, the number of Media displayed per page is determined. If more than one page of Media is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided. Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward. Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display.

#### [Screen options](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

The [Screen Options](#documentation/article/administration-screens) allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. In addition, the number of Media items to display in the [Table of Media](#documentation/article/media-library-screen) can be set. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.

#### [Search](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

Above the Table, to the right, is a Search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and hit the Enter key to search and display all the Media meeting your search words.

### [Filtering options](#documentation/article/media-library-screen-2)

At the top of List view, you can filter the media by media type and date:

**All**

This dropdown allows you to select, by media type such as Images, Audio and Video or Unattached to any Posts nor Pages, which Media are displayed in the [Table of Media](#documentation/article/media-library-screen). By default, âAllâ is selected and all of your Media are displayed.

**All dates**

This dropdown allows you to select, by date, which Media are displayed in the [Table of Media](#documentation/article/media-library-screen). By default, âAll datesâ is selected and all of your Media are displayed.

**Filter**

Clicking this button applies the settings you select in the dropdown.

### [Using selection, actions, and apply](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

#### [Selection](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

This Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more Media selected in the Table. For Bulk Actions to be performed on multiple Media at once, those Media must be first **selected** via one of these methods:

- **Select one Media at a time** â To select a Media, the checkbox to the left of the Media entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Media by checking their respective checkbox.
- **Select all Media in given Table** â All Media in a given table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Tableâs title, or footer bar. Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected).
- **Reverse Selection** â A Reverse Selection means checked items become unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse Selection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and clicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.

#### [Actions](#documentation/article/media-library-screen)

Actions describe the process to be performed on particular Media. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as *Bulk Actions* and *Immediate Actions*. The follow describes these Actions:

- **Bulk actions** â These Actions can be performed on one, or more Media, at one time, if those Media have been previously [selected](#documentation/article/media-library-screen). Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk Actions pulldown box, above the Table. The only Bulk Action allowed is Delete Permanently.
- **Immediate actions** â Immediate Actions are performed immediately, on an individual Media. Hovering the mouse cursor over the Media row reveals the Edit, Delete Permanently, and View options under the File column, in that Media row. Clicking on a Media Title will also initiate the Edit Action.

The available Actions are described below:

- **Edit** â This Immediate Action displays the Edit Media Screen. This Action can be initiated by click on the Media Title. See the [Edit Media](#documentation/article/edit-media) for details on editing Media information.
- **Delete permanently** â This Action deletes the Media. Delete Permanently is available both as a Bulk Action, and an Immediate Action.
- **View** â This Action presents the Media in a simulated view of how the image would look when displayed in your Theme. View is available only as an Immediate Action.

# Comments in WordPress <a name="documentation/article/comments-in-wordpress" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comments-in-wordpress/

Comments allow your websiteâs visitors to have a discussion with you and each other. When you activate comments on a [Page](/support/article/pages/) or post, WordPress inserts several text boxes after your content where users can submit their comments. Once you approve a comment, it appears underneath your content. Whether you want to customize how you receive comments or tweak how your site displays comments, WordPress provides a thorough set of options to build a community from the visitors to your site.

## Comment screen

All comments on a WordPress website are displayed on the **Comments** dashboard in your WordPress admin area. It displays all comments by default

![Comments dashboard](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard.png?fit=1024%2C572&ssl=1)You can switch the view to see Pending, Approved, Spam, and Trash comments:

- **Pending:** comments submitted by your visitors, but wonât be visible on your blog posts unless you approve them.
- **Approved:** comments published and are publicly visible on your blog posts by all your website visitors.
- **Spam**: comments flagged as possibly unwanted or irrelevant, and arenât visible to your site visitors.
- **Trash**: comments marked as unwanted and will be automatically deleted for good after 30 days.

Moving your mouse over to a comment will display the action links for it. You can approve a comment to make it visible to all your site visitors, or unapprove it to put it in pending status again.

You can also reply to comments. By replying to a specific comment, your reply will appear right under that comment. This is called âthreadedâ or ânestedâ comments.

You can also choose to edit anyoneâs comments on your own site. The **Quick Edit** option opens a text area so you can edit the comment without reloading the page. **Edit**, on the other hand, gives you more options to edit the name, user email, and more.

Once a visitor submits his or her comment, WordPress follows your preferences and either hold the comment for your approval or posts it immediately.

If you see a comment marked as spam thatâs actually a real comment, then you can mark it as **Not Spam** by hovering your mouse over it.

Comments in the trash section are comments that have been deleted by you. Any comment in the trash can be restored by clicking on **Restore**. Comments in trash remain there for 30 days after this time WordPress deletes them permanently.

## Discussion settings

Before you enable comments on posts or [Pages](/support/article/pages/), reviewing the options under [Settings](/support/article/settings-general-screen/) &gt; [Discussion](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) can help make your life as a moderator easier. Use these settings to restrict comments and reduce the amount of spam you receive.

### Notification

![Settings > Discussion > Default post settings.
page sample image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings.png)If you link another site post on your site, **Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the post** will enable your site to notify the website owners that you have linked to them. They can then choose to tell their users that another site linked to them through a [trackback or pingback](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/).

Just like the option above, you can enable your site to accept pingbacks and trackbacks from other websites by checking **Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new posts**.

### Comment rules

**Allow people to post comments on new articles** will enable you to disable comments if you donât need comments on your websites.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/other-comment-settings.png)**Comment author must fill out name and e-mail** prevents people from leaving anonymous comments.

**Users must be registered and logged in to comment** will only allow registered users of your site to post comments.

**Automatically close comments on articles older than \_\_\_\_\_ days** will close comments on a post that have reached a set time. This is a good way to limit spam comments.

### Comment display

**Enable threaded (nested) comments \_\_\_\_\_ levels deep**: will allow your users to reply to one another. A reply to a comment is shown ânestedâ underneath the original comments. You can limit how many levels (a reply to a reply) of replies your site will allow by changing the number of levels.

**Break comments into Pages with \_\_\_\_\_top level comments per Page and the \_\_\_\_\_ Page displayed by default** will change how your comments are displayed. You can set how many comments you see per Page and if the oldest or newest comments are displayed first.

**Comments should be displayed with the \_\_\_\_\_ comments at the top of each Page** will place newer or older comments at the top of each page.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration.png)### Comment administration

**Email me whenever â¦ Anyone posts a comment** and/or **A comment is held for moderation** will help you stay up to date on your comments. If you donât check your site often.

**Comment must be manually approved** will help you moderate the comments published on your site.

**Comment author must have a previously approved comment** will help moderate the comments published on your site.

### Comment spam

![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-moderation.png?fit=1024%2C338&ssl=1)**Hold a comment in the queue if it contains \_\_\_\_\_ links**, Spam comments are designed to get users to click on links in order to drive traffic to other sites. As a result, many spam comments contain multiple links. Setting this option to hold all comments that contain 2 or more links will help catch more spam.

You can experiment with **Comment Moderation and Comment Blacklist** to catch spam that contains certain words or is posted from a particular IP address. Comments caught through blacklisting are not deleted but instead [moved to your spam folder](#documentation/article/comment-moderation).

Because spam is pervasive on the Web, some of the comments you receive will most likely be spam. However, WordPress developers and administrators have already developed a number of [successful strategies to help you prevent spam comments](#documentation/article/faq-working-with-wordpress) from appearing on your site. In addition to experimenting with different options in [Settings](#documentation/article/settings-general-screen) &gt;[ Discussion](#documentation/article/settings-discussion-screen), you can install a [WordPress Plugin](#plugins) like [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) or [make other changes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam) to help you keep spam comments under control.

### Avatars

The settings under âAvatarsâ control the images your site displays next to comments. For an introduction to Gravatars, read the WordPress Lesson about [ How to Use Gravatars in WordPress](/support/article/how-to-use-gravatars/).

## Enabling comments on your site

Once you have decided on your discussion options, you are ready to enable comments. If you chose not to enable comments on all articles automatically, you can turn on comments for a specific post or Page in several ways.

### Turning on comments for a single post or page

![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/enable-comment-on-page-1.png?fit=1024%2C480&ssl=1)  
On the post or page you wish to add comments to, find the âDiscussionâ box, and check âAllow Comments.â (If you do not see the âDiscussionâ box on the Edit Page, click âScreen Optionsâ in the upper right corner of the browser window. Make sure the box next to âDiscussionâ is checked.) Save your changes by clicking âPublishâ, âSave Draftâ or âUpdate.

### Turning on comments from the posts or pages screen

![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/enable-comment-from-quick-edit.png?fit=1024%2C228&ssl=1)Navigate to the Posts/Pages screen. In the list of pages or posts, find the one you want and hover your cursor over the title of the post. You will see several links appear underneath the title. Click âQuick Editâ and check âAllow Comments.â Click âUpdateâ to turn comments on for that post.

### Turning on comments for multiple posts or pages

From the Posts/Pages screen, check the boxes next to the posts or Pages on which you want to enable comments. Select âEditâ from the âBulk Editâ Dropdown box and click Apply. Then, select âAllowâ next in the Comments dropdown box and finish by clicking âupdate.â

# Users Your Profile screen <a name="documentation/article/users-your-profile-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/users-your-profile-screen/

## Users â Your Profile

The [Your Profile Screen](/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/) is accessible from both the main navigation menu under [Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#your-profile) and by clicking on your name link at the top of the WordPress screen. Here you can specify your name and how it will be displayed on your site, your e-mail address (for administrative purposes), other personal information, and personal options.

[![](#documentation/files/2018/10/profile.png)](#documentation/files/2018/10/profile.png)Your Profile Screen## Your Profile and Personal Options

The only pieces of information WordPress requires you to include in your Profile are your **e-mail address** and a **nickname**. It should be noted that WordPress requires your email address only for your blogâs administration purposes. The email address is never sent to any other site (not even to the people at WordPress headquarters), and it is never displayed on your site (unless you put it there manually). Only the other *registered* users of your blog have access to the e-mail address you provide. Also, remember that each userâs email address must be unique.

**Note**: it is *possible* for a theme to display your e-mail address (and the e-mail addresses of your other registered users) on your site, since the [`the_author_meta('user_email')`](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Template Tags/the_author_meta>) template tag can be used for such purposes. This would be a poorly conceived theme, however, if it didnât inform you of that before you downloaded it. None of the themes included with WordPress display any e-mail address anywhere on the public side of your site by default.

All of the other personal information asked for here is *optional*, and, again, it is never sent to any other site or person. It *may* be displayed on your site, however, depending on the theme you use, so you should test things out with your particular theme if youâre at all paranoid (and a bit of paranoia regarding your personal information is healthy). See [the\_author](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_author) and related template tags for information on how to display this information on your site (and, consequently, how to ensure the theme you use does/does not display any of this information). Typically, themes only display the information you enter in the **Display name publicly as** field, however the Authors username is also often included in the URL (for Author Archives) and in the CSS classes for per-author targeted stylings.

**Personal Options :**

- **Visual Editor** â Checking this box **Disables the visual editor when writing**, and uses the plain HTML editor.
- **Syntax Highlighting** â Checking this box **Disable syntax highlighting when editing code**.
- **Admin Color Scheme** â Check this radio button next to the color scheme desired for the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens). The left two colors are menu background colors and the right two are roll-over colors.

[![](#documentation/files/2018/10/profile-colors.png)](#documentation/files/2018/10/profile-colors.png)Color scheme of Administration Screens- **Keyboard Shortcuts** â Checking this box **Enables keyboard shortcuts for comment moderation**. Keyboard shortcuts are designed to allow you to rapidly navigate and perform actions on comments. The [Keyboard Shortcuts article](/support/article/keyboard-shortcuts/) describes the various shortcuts in detail.
- **Toolbar** â Check the box to display the [Toolbar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Toolbar) when you are viewing your site.
- **Language** â You can select the language you wish to use while using the [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/) without affecting the language site visitors see.

**Name :**

- **Username** â You cannot edit your Username because it is used as your Username during the login process. Even an [Administrator](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/) cannot change your Username. Usually, no one else ever needs to see your Username.
- **First name** â Enter your first name in this text box.
- **Last name** â Enter your last name in this text box.
- **Nickname** â Enter the nickname as it is a required for every user. It may be the same as your **User Name** or it can be different. If you donât supply a Nickname, then the **User Name** will be placed in this field.
- **Display name publicly as** â Select, from the drop-down, how your name is cited on your blog. This defaults to your first and last name. You can choose from several of the above pieces of information: **Nickname**, **Login** name, **First Name**, **Last Name**, â**First Last**â, or â**Last First**â. If you prefer â**Last, First**â, insert a comma after your last name in the **Last Name** text box above and choose the last option from this dropdown.

**Contact Info :**

- **E-mail** â All users are required to list an e-mail address in their respective Profiles. The E-mail address must be unique for each user. Your blog will use this address to notify you of new comments to your posts and for other administrative purposes. To reiterate what was said above, only other registered users of your blog will have access to this e-mail address. It is *never* sent anywhere.
- **Website** â Enter your website address.

**About Yourself :**

- **Biographical Info** â Enter a short description or profile of yourself here. This optional information can be displayed by your theme if so configured by the theme author. See [`the_author_meta('description')`](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Template Tags/the_author_meta>) template tag.
- **Profile Picture** â Your picture in [Gravatar](/support/article/Glossary/#gravatar) is shown here. To change it, access to the https://en.gravatar.com/. See also [Using Gravatars](/support/article/how-to-use-gravatars/).

**Account Management :**

- **Generate Password** â You can click this button to generate a new password for the account. This will show you a new field with the generated password. If you choose to change this password, a checkbox will appear to confirm that you want to use a weak password. You can check this box to confirm that you want to use your own password instead of a secure one.
- **Strength Indicator** This indicates if the password you entered is Very Weak, Weak, Medium, or Strong (displayed in green). The stronger the password the more secure your login. Hint: The password should be at least seven characters long. To make it stronger, use upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols like *!â?$%^&amp;)*.
- **Log Out Everywhere Else** â You can click this button to log out of other devices, such as your phone or a public computer.

### Update Profile

Remember to click this button to save the changes you have made to your Profile and Personal Options. After clicking this button you should see a splash message at the top of the screen saying User Updated. If you donât see that message, then your changes are not saved!

# Administration Screens <a name="documentation/article/administration-screens" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/

The Administration Screen provides access to the control features of your WordPress installation.

## Common Layout

Each Administration Screen is presented in sections, the toolbar (and header), the main navigation, the work area, and the footer.

![](#documentation/files/2018/10/administrations_screen_4.9.4_with_note.jpg)Administration Screen**Toolbar** has links to various administration functions, and is displayed at the top of each Administration Screen. Many Toolbar items expand (flyout) when hovered over to display more information.

**Main Navigation** menu details each of the administrative functions you can perform. At the bottom of that section is a Collapse menu button that shrinks the menu into a set of icons, or to expands to list them by major function. Within each major function, such as Posts, the sub-menu expands (fly-out) when hovered over, and expands fully if an item clicked.

In the **work area**, the specific information relating to a particular navigation choice, such as adding a new post, is presented and collected.

**Footer**, at the bottom of each Administration Screen in light shading, are links to [WordPress](#), thanking you for using it, and the **version** of WordPress you have installed is shown.

## Toolbar â Keeping It All Together

The Toolbar contains links to information About WordPress, as well as quick-links to create new posts, pages and links, add new plugins and users, review comments, and alerts to available updates to plugins and themes on your site.

**Tips**: To hide the Toolbar, go to Administration Screens &gt; Users &gt; Your Profile, and turn off âShow Toolbar when viewing siteâ of Toolbar option.

### About WordPress

At the left-most side of the Toolbar is a WordPress logo. Place, or hover, the mouse cursor over the logo to see to [About WordPress](#about/), [WordPress.org](#), [Documentation](/support), [Support](/support), and [Feedback](/support/forum/requests-and-feedback).

![WordPress About Menu](#documentation/files/2018/10/WordPress-About-Menu-1-1024x482.jpg)The top link on that menu is for the âAbout WordPressâ page, which contains tabs for Whatâs New, Credits, Freedoms and Privacy.

- **Whatâs New** screen describes many of the new features WordPress current version.
- **Credits** screen provides some details about the various individuals who contribute to the WordPress code base.
- **Freedoms** screen describes your rights as a user of WordPress as open source software.
- **Privacy** screen describes handling of privacy information in WordPress.

### Visit Site link

In the Toolbar, to the right of the WordPress logo, your site name is displayed as a link. Hover over the site name to see the View Site link to visit the main page of your site.

### Howdy, User

On the far right of the Toolbar is âHowdy, Userâ, with an image of your Gravatar. When hovered over, this expands to link you to your Profile Screen as well as a Log Out link.

![](#documentation/files/2018/10/howdyuser.jpg)Howdy, UserWhen you log in to your blog, WordPress stores a so called *cookie* in your web browser. This cookie allows WordPress to remember who you are; if you leave your blogâs site for a while but come back to it later, WordPress will see the cookie and not require you to log in again.

**Tips**: If you have a WordPress cookie set in your web browser, anyone using your computer can access the Administration Screens of your blog. If you *donât* want this to happen (perhaps you are using a public computer or a computer which other people use), you can click this **Log Out** link, and WordPress will delete the cookie from your web browser.

### Screen Options

Screen Options, displayed as a hanging tab under **the toolbar**, allow the user to decide what fields or modules are presented in the **work area** for a given Administration Screen. Each Screen may have a different set of Screen Options.

Click on the Screen Options tab to expand the options available for a particular Screen, check (or uncheck) the desired options, then click the Screen Options hanging tab to collapse the Screen Options.

![](#documentation/files/2018/10/screenoptions.png)Screen Options### Help

Contextual **Help**, displayed as a hanging tab under **the toolbar**, displays one or more Help items that are related to the Screen that is displayed in the **work area**.

Click on the Help tab to expand the Help available for a particular Screen, then click the Help hanging tab to collapse the Help display.

## Dashboard â Information Central 

The Dashboard tells you about recent activity both at your site and in the WordPress community, and update information.

### Dashboard

**Welcome â** Shows links for some of the most common tasks when setting up a new site.

**At A Glance â** Displays a summary of the content on your site and identifies which theme and version of WordPress you are using.

**Activity â** Shows the upcoming scheduled posts, recently published posts, and the most recent comments on your posts and allows you to moderate them.

**Quick Draft â** Allows you to create a new post and save it as a draft. Also displays links to the 5 most recent draft posts youâve started.

**WordPress Events and News** â Latest local events and news from the official WordPress project.

**PHP Info** â Shows the current PHP version your WordPress website is running on and whether the update is needed.

**Site Health Status** â Overview of current state of your website and if any parts of it needs improvements.

### Updates

You can update to the latest version of WordPress, as well as update your themes, plugins, and translations from the WordPress.org repositories.

If an update is available, youá¾¿ll see a notification appear in the Toolbar and navigation menu. Keeping your site updated is important for security. It also makes the internet a safer place for you and your readers.

#### Updating WordPress

Click on the **Update Now** button when you are notified that a new version is available.

**Tips**: In most cases, WordPress will automatically apply maintenance and security updates in the background for you.

#### Updating Themes, Plugins and Translations

To update individual themes, plugins or Translations, use the checkboxes to make your selection, then click on the appropriate **Update** button.

To update all of your themes, plugins or Translations at once, you can check the box at the top of the section to select all before clicking the **update** button.

## Posts â Make some content 

[Posts](/support/article/glossary/#post) are the principal element (or content) of a blog. The Posts are the writings, compositions or discussions.

### All Posts

Via the [All Posts Screen](/support/article/posts-screen/) you can select the Post or Posts you wish to edit, delete, or view. Multiple Posts can be selected for deletion and for editing. A powerful bulk edit feature allows you to change certain fields for a group of Posts. A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Post. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Posts you want to edit or delete.

### Add New Post

[Posts Add New Screen](/support/article/writing-posts/) is where you write new Posts. While you are writing those Posts, you can also create new Categories and new Tags. In addition, any Media (pictures, video, recordings, files) can be uploaded and inserted into the Posts.

### Categories

Every Post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories. Categories allow the classification of your Posts into groups and subgroups, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation and use of your site.

Each Category may be assigned to a Category Parent so that you may set up a hierarchy within the category structure. Using automobiles as an example, a hierarchy might be Car-&gt;Ford-&gt;Mustang. In creating categories, recognize that each category name must be unique, regardless of hierarchy.

When using the WordPress default theme, all the Categories to which a given post belongs are displayed under that post. When someone viewing your blog clicks on one of those Category links, a archive page with all the Posts belonging to that Category will be displayed.

The [Posts Categories Screen](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts Categories Screen>) allows you to add, edit, and delete Categories, as well as organize your categories hierarchically. Multiple Categories can be selected for deletion. A search option allows you to find the Categories you want to edit or delete. Also remember Categories can be added in the [Posts Add New Screen](/support/article/writing-posts/).

### Tags

Tags are the keywords you might assign to each post. Not to be confused with Categories, Tags have no hierarchy, meaning thereâs no relationship from one Tag to another. But like Categories, Tags provide another means to aid your readers in accessing information on your blog.

When using the WordPress default theme, Tags are displayed under each Post those Tags are assigned. Someone viewing your blog can click on one of those Tag links, and an archive page with all the Posts belonging to that Tag will be displayed.

The [Posts Tags Screen](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts Tags Screen>) allows you to add, change, or delete Tags. Multiple Tags can be selected for deletion. A search option allows you to find the Tags you want to edit or delete. Also remember Tags can be added in the [Posts A](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts Add New Screen>)[dd New Screen.](/support/article/writing-posts/)

## Media â Add pictures and movies to your posts 

Media is the images, video, recordings, and files, you upload and use in your blog. Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when writing a Post or Page. Note that the Uploading Files section in the [Settings Media Screen](/support/article/settings-media-screen/) describes the location and structure of the upload directory.

### Library

The [Media Library Screen](/support/article/media-library-screen/) allows you add, edit, delete or view Media previously uploaded to your blog. Multiple Media objects can be selected for deletion. Search and filtering ability is also provided to allow you to find the desired Media.

### Add New Media

The [Media Add New Screen](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Media Add New Screen>) allows you to upload new media to later use with posts and pages. A drag and drop Uploader is provided and the ability to use a Browser Uploader button is also supplied.

### Edit Media

The [Edit Media](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Edit Media>) page allows you to edit the information (title, caption, alt text, etc.) of media files uploaded to your site. This page does not appear as a link in the main Dashboard navigation, but is reached by clicking on the Edit link in the [Media Library Screen](/support/article/media-library-screen/) that appears when you hover over each item, or when uploading media for the first time on the [Media Add New Screen](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Media Add New Screen>) once your upload has completed.

## Pages â Your Static Content 

A [Page](/support/article/glossary/#page) is another tool to add content to a WordPress site and is often used to present âstaticâ information about the site; Pages are typically âtimelessâ in nature. A good example of a Page is the information contained in âAboutâ or âContactâ Pages. A Page should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called Posts, nor should a WordPress Page be confused with the word âpageâ referring to any web page or HTML document on the Web.

Because Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology, and as such, are not displayed with the rest of your Posts, but are displayed individually.

### All Pages

The [All Pages Screen](/support/article/pages-screen/) provides the necessary tools to edit, delete or view existing Pages. On this Screen you can select the Page to edit, delete or view. Multiple Pages can be selected for deletion and for editing. A powerful bulk edit tool allows certain fields to be edited for a whole group of Pages. A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Page. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Pages you want to edit or delete.

### Add New Page

The [Add New Page Screen](/support/article/pages-add-new-screen/) allows you to create new Pages. Also see the [Pages article](/support/article/pages/) for an in depth discussion.

## Comments â Reader Feedback 

Comments are a feature of blogs which allow readers to respond to Posts.

In the [Comments Screen](#documentation/article/comments-screen/) you can edit and delete as well as mark comments as spam. Comments that are awaiting moderation can be marked as approved or previously approved comments can be unapproved. Multiple comments can be selected and approved, marked as spam, unapproved, or deleted. A section at the top of the Comments Screen displays the number of comments awaiting moderation and the number of approved comments. A search box allows you to find specific comments

## Appearance â Change the Look of your Blog 

WordPress allows you to easily style your site by either installing and activating new Themes or customizing existing Themes.

**Tips**: From Theme Customizer launched by Appearance &gt; Customize, you can customize all other options such as Theme, Widgets, Menus and Header. Also, modern theme has other settings or options. You should try Theme Customizer

### Themes

A Theme is the overall design of a site and encompasses color, graphics, and text. WordPress site-owners have available a long list of Themes to choose from in deciding what to present to their sitesâ viewers.

From the [Appearance Themes Screen](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance Themes Screen>), you can choose which Theme will be presented to users visiting your site. You can also view screenshots of each Theme you have uploaded to your site. In addition, under the Install Themes tab you can find and install new Themes.

### Customize

The [Customize Screen](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance Customize Screen>) displays the settings that can be customized for a specific theme. For instance, the WordPress default theme provides options that allows the user to set the colors and a background image.

### Import

WordPress supports the importing data from a number external sources. In many cases, posts, comments, pages, categories, tags, and users, can be imported.

The [Importing Content](/support/article/importing-content/) for a more extensive list of import possibilites.

### Export

WordPress Export will create an XML file for you to save to your computer. The format, which is called a WordPress eXtended RSS or WXR file, will contain your posts, comments, custom fields, categories, and tags.

The [Tools Export Screen](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Tools Export Screen>) guides you through the easy process of exporting your blog. Take note that the Exporting is a useful method to backup your WordPress data.

There are two tabs on the site health page:

1\. **Status** â The status tab allows you to see critical information about your WordPress configuration, along with anything else that requires your attention.

2\. **Info** â The info tab is a granular view of the technical aspects of your WordPress website. You can see detailed information about every aspect of your site such as themes, plugins, and media. There is also a useful export feature that allows you to copy all of the information about your site to the clipboard.Settings â Configuration Settings

## General

In the Settings Administration Screen are all of the settings that define your blog as a whole: settings which determine how your site behaves, how you interact with your site, and how the rest of the world interacts with your site.

In addition, you can adjust [syndication feed](/support/article/glossary/#feed) features to determine how the information from your site is sent to a readerâs web browser or other applications.

### Discussion

The [Setti](/getting-started/settings-discussion-screen/)[ngs Discussion Screen](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) allows you to control settings concerning incoming and outgoing comments, pingbacks and trackbacks.

# Dashboard screen <a name="documentation/article/dashboard-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dashboard-screen/

## Dashboard â Home

From the Dashboard Screen, you can quickly access your siteâs content and get glimpses into other areas of the WordPress community.

The Dashboard screen presents information in blocks called **widgets**. By default, WordPress delivers five widgets on this page: [At a Glance](#at-a-glance), [Activity](#activity), [Quick Draft](#quickdraft), [WordPress Events and News](#wordpress-events-and-news), and [Welcome](#welcome).

## Default Dashboard Widgets

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/500px-dashboard.png)Dashboard Screen

The following dashboard widgets are included by default with WordPress:

### At a Glance

The At a Glance widget provides a summary of the number of posts, pages, and comments on your site. Each of these content types are displayed in the form of a link and, when clicked upon, direct you to the specific area to manage that content.

A statement at the bottom of this widget tells you what WordPress version youâre running on, as well as the current theme that you have activated on your site.

### Activity

This widget shows the upcoming scheduled posts, recently published posts, and the most recent comments on your postsâand allows you to moderate them.

A list of the most recent comments on your blog is detailed in this widget. Each comment that is listed has a link to the related post titleâclicking this link allows you to edit the post. Hovering the mouse over each comment activates a menu of choices: to approve (or unapprove) the comment, edit the comment, reply to the comment, mark the comment as spam, or delete the comment.

### QuickDraft

The QuickDraft widget allows you to quickly and easily write a new draft. Enter a post title, upload/insert media, enter the post content, add tags, and click the **Publish** button or click the **Save Draft** button. Itâs that easy!

### WordPress Events and News

This Dashboard widget lists upcoming local events and the latest news from the official [WordPress blog](https://www.wordpress.org/development/).

Here you can find out an upcoming event near you, or, what [WordPress developers](#about) have been up to recently, and you can also keep up with the latest WordPress related news. In addition to software developmentsâsuch as version announcements and security noticesânews about the WordPress community in general is periodically posted.

### Welcome

The Welcome widget shows links for some of the most common tasks when setting up a new site.

## Screen Options

The Screen Options panel allows you to choose which widgets are displayed or not displayed.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/700px-screenoptions.png)Screen Options

When you click on the Screen Options tab, the resulting panel shows the various Dashboard widgets, with a checkbox next to each widget. Check the box to display a specific widget, or uncheck the box to hide that widget.

Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options panel.

## Expanding, Collapsing, and Rearranging Widgets

Each widget can be expanded or contracted by clicking on the widget title bar.

Widgets can be moved by hovering the mouse cursor over the widget title bar. When the mouse cursor changes to four arrows, hold the left mouse button down, drag the widget to where you want to place it, and then release the mouse button (this cursor motion is called drag and drop).

## Adding new Dashboard Widgets

Plugin or theme developers can make new Dashboard widgets available through the plugin (or functions.php) code. For more information, see the [Dashboard Widgets API](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard Widgets API>).

# Appearance Menus Screen <a name="documentation/article/appearance-menus-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/appearance-menus-screen/

**Warning:** WordPress 5.9 is the last version with this screen available. In WordPress 6.0 and later managing menus is done via [navigation block](#documentation/article/navigation-block).

The Menus Screen enables the user to create a custom menu (also known as a navigation bar, navigation menu, or main menu). It is a section of the site that helps visitors to navigate the site. Depending on the theme used, typically a site will have one navigation menu, while some themes may enable secondary or footer menus. It is essential to have a simplified navigation menu, so as not to confuse your visitors.

In your menu, you can add different items such as links to pages, articles, categories, or custom links to the url of your choice, such as another site, and then choose the order of the items and their hierarchy (possibility of creating submenus). In short, your menu is fully customizable.

The Appearance Menus Screen is accessible from the Dashboard via **Appearance** &gt; **Menus.**

[![The interface of Appearance > Menus](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-2.png)](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-2.png)## Screen options

The [Screen Options](/support/article/administration-screens/#screen-options) allow you to choose which modules are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Screen. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the possible modules and options with a check-box next to each. Check the box for each module or option you want displayed, or uncheck the box to not display that module. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.

Certain modules, like **Posts** are hidden by default.

## Creating menus

![Creating a new menu](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/02/image-5.png)1. Go to the WordPress Dashboard.
2. From the âAppearanceâ menu on the left-hand side of the Dashboard, select the âMenusâ option to bring up the Menu Editor.
3. Click the link **Create a new menu** at the top of the page.
4. Enter a name for your new menu in the Menu Name box
5. Click the **Create Menu** button.

## Adding items to a menu

[![Adding items to a menu](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-6.png)](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-6.png)You can add different item types into your menu, such as Pages, Categories, or even Custom Links. These are split between panes left of the menu youâre currently editing. An example on how to add link to a page:

1. Locate the pane entitled **Pages**.
2. Within this pane, select the *View All* link to bring up a list of all the currently published Pages on your site.
3. Select the Pages that you want to add by clicking the checkbox next to each Pageâs title.
4. Click the **Add to Menu** button located at the bottom of this pane to add your selection(s) to the menu that you created in the previous step.
5. Click the **Save Menu** button once youâve added all the menu items you want.

Your custom menu has now been saved.

**Note:** The [Screen Options](/support/article/administration-screens/#screen-options) allow you to choose which items you can use to add to a menu. Certain items, like **Tags** are hidden by default.

## Deleting a menu item

[![Deleting a menu item](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-7.png)](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-7.png)1. Locate the menu item that you want to remove in the menu editor window
2. Click on the arrow icon in the top right-hand corner of the menu item to expand it.
3. Click on the *Remove* item. The menu item will be immediately removed.
4. Click the **Save Menu** button to save your changes.

## Deleting menu items in bulk

1. To delete multiple menu items at once, click on the checkbox *Bulk Select*.
2. Select the checkbox next to each of the menu items you wish to delete.
3. Click *Remove Selected Items*. This will delete the selected menu items from the menu in bulk.

## Creating multi-level menus

When planning the structure of your menu, it helps to think of each menu item as a heading in a formal report document. In a formal report, main section headings (Level 1 headings) are the nearest to the left of the page; sub-section headings (Level 2 headings) are indented slightly further to the right; any other subordinate headings (Level 3, 4, etc) within the same section are indented even further to the right.

The WordPress menu editor allows you to create multi-level menus using a simple âdrag and dropâ interface. Drag menu items up or down to change their order of appearance in the menu. Drag menu items left or right in order to create sub-levels within your menu.

To make one menu item a subordinate of another, you need to position the âchildâ underneath its âparentâ and then drag it slightly to the right.

1. Position the mouse over the âchildâ menu item.
2. Whilst holding the left mouse button, drag it to the right.
3. Release the mouse button.
4. Repeat these steps for each sub-menu item.
5. Click the **Save Menu** button in the Menu Editor to save your changes.

## Adding your menu to your site

If your current theme supports custom menus, you will be able to add your new menu to one of the **Theme Locations**.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the menu editor window.
2. Under *Menu Settings* -&gt; *Display location*, click the check box for the location where you want your menu to appear.
3. Click **Save Menu** once youâve made your selection.

[![Adding menu to your site](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-8.png)](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-8.png)If your current theme does not support custom menus, you will need to add your new menu via the Custom Menu widget in the [Appearance Widgets Screen](#documentation/article/appearance-widgets-screen).

## Rearranging, configuring menu items

Once an item is added to a menu, those menu items can be rearranged. Placing the mouse cursor over the menu item title, when the mouse cursor changes to cross-arrow, hold the left mouse button down, drag the module to where you want to place it, then release the mouse button (this is called drag-and-drop). Remember you can drag a menu item slightly to the right of the menu item above it to create a **hierarchy** (parent/child) relationship in the menu.

Each Menu Item has a configuration arrow on the right side of the Menu Item title, that when clicked opens the configuration box. Click the arrow a second time to close the configuration box. If you donât see Link Target, Title Attribute, CSS Classes, Link Relationship (XFN), and Description, then under Screen Options make sure those boxes are checked to expose them here.

[![Menu options](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-9.png)](#documentation/files/2024/02/image-9.png)Then configuration choices are:

**Navigation Label**

The label for this particular menu item

**Title Attribute**

The attribute used when displaying the label

**Open link in new tab**

Click the checkbox to open the menu item in a new tab

**CSS Classes**

Optional CSS Classes for this menu item

**Link Relationship (XFN)**

Allows for the generation of XFN attributes automatically so you can show how you are related to the authors/owners of site to which you are linking. See [Link Relationship](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Links_Add_New_Screen#Link_Relationship_.28XFN.29 Link Relationship>) for details.

**Description**

Description for this link. The description will be displayed in the menu if the current theme supports it.

**Original**

A link to the original source of the menu item (e.g. a link to view the post or page).

**Move**

Links to move the menu item *Up one* level, *Down one* level, *Under the previous menu item* as its child, *To the top*

**Remove**

Remove this menu item from the menu

**Cancel**

Cancel the configuration of the menu item

# Manage Plugins <a name="documentation/article/manage-plugins" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/

## What are plugins?

[WordPress Plugins](#plugins) are PHP scripts that extend the functionality of WordPress. They enhance the features of WordPress or add entirely new features to your site. Plugins are often developed by volunteers and are usually free to the public.

Plugins are available via the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins). Although plugins you find here are thoroughly tested and considered safe to use, they are of varying quality and are often works in progress.

### **How do they relate to WordPress core?**

The WordPress content management system software, or WordPress core, provides the primary functionality for publishing content and managing users. Each WordPress plugin is an additional piece of software that can be easily installed to extend the functionality of WordPress core.

This allows you to customize your WordPress site with your desired functionality. Since so much functionality is provided through plugins, WordPress core is full-featured and customizable, without having to include everything for everyone.

### **What are some examples?**

Some of the more popular plugins in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins) fall into these categories:

- Spam control
- SEO
- Data import and export
- E-commerce
- Security
- Caching

This is just a small sample. There are thousands of plugins available in the directory, so thereâs a good chance youâll find some that are useful to you.

## Finding and Installing Plugins

### **Finding Plugins**

You can browse and search for plugins in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins). Each plugin listed there is available for download as a zip file you can upload to your WordPress site.

An alternative way to find and install plugins is from within the WordPress admin screens. Navigate to **Plugins &gt; Add New**, and you can browse and search for plugins from within your dashboard.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TfnDziq6tE1BaXQgJygVht4KMRdRIdOQOWRMJnA3XCYfLbgq02cY3OvdMOBZ8FUCl38zaSJsJrz7la39dKcLRS3jDLLXqHsCpoXPyFw__iRIsOQnjngM_jFtN59B7i5b64VKyUYU)Each plugin listed there has an âInstall Nowâ button so you can easily add it to your site.

### **Plugin Compatibility**

If a plugin hasnât been updated since the most recent update to WordPress core, it may be incompatible, or its compatibility may be unknown. You can view compatibility information about plugins from the Add Plugins page, or from the Installed Plugins list.

#### Compatibility of New Plugins

To learn about the compatibility of a plugin before you install it, navigate to **Plugins &gt; Add New.** Each plugin description on this page includes a note that reads âCompatible with your version of WordPressâ or âUntested with your version of WordPress.â You can click the âMore Detailsâ link to see information about this pluginâs compatibility.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/owermNk0T0VyD2wCRRL1rc78jdyVdhBPzi4wN8ClBpgzGV5hgXY5QrPlF1p3BLjwtOYtXwx9embtqtSpiVVWEWiJ5X9HB-Xui0Xoz0LizzbKaq-jDkMsLvU83c7U3vzXRu4TZe-Y)#### Compatibility of Installed Plugins

To learn about the compatibility of plugins youâve already installed, click the âPluginsâ link in the left nav of your siteâs dashboard. Each item on this list should contain a âView detailsâ link. Click this to see information about this pluginâs compatibility with different versions of WordPress.

There are 3 ways to install WordPress plugins.

**Automatic Plugin Installation.** Any plugin available in the WordPress Plugins Directory can be installed via the built-in plugin installer.

**Upload via WordPress Admin.** You can easily add a new plugin by uploading a zip archive of the plugin from your local computer.

**Manual Plugin Installation.** In some cases, you may need to manually upload a plugin directly using an SFTP client.

### **Automatic Plugin Installation**

This is the simplest method of installing a plugin. To add a plugin using the built-in plugin installer:

1. Navigate to **Plugins &gt; Add New**.

In rare cases, you may need to install a plugin by manually transferring the files onto the server. This is recommended only when absolutely necessary, for example when your server is not configured to allow automatic installations.

This procedure requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client. It is recommended for advanced users and developers.

Here are the detailed instructions to manually install a WordPress plugin by transferring the files onto the webserver.

1. Download the plugin zip file from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins) and unzip it locally. For example, in the case of Gutenberg plugin, download as gutenberg.X.Y.Z.zip (X.Y.Z is version) and unzip it to get the gutenberg/ folder.
2. Transfer the extracted folder to the wp-content/plugins directory of your WordPress site via SFTP or remote file manager.
3. From the Plugins menu in the Administration Screen, click Activate for the transferred plugin.

## Plugin Favorites

You can add a plugin to your list of favorites, and you can view and easily install another WordPress.org userâs favorite plugins.

### **Favorite a Plugin**

1. Log in to the [WordPress Plugins Directory](#plugins) using your WordPress.org ID.
2. Find the plugin you want to like and go to the pluginâs page.

- You updated a single plugin and experienced issues with your site soon after that.
- Thereâs an error message telling you exactly which plugin file is causing the issue.
- Try deactivating plugins one at a time until you find the one thatâs causing the issue.
- Once you find the plugin that is causing the issue, you can either deactivate and activate it again to see if this helps. Or you can find other similar plugins from the [WordPress Plugins Directory](#plugins), install and activate it and see if this resolves the issue.

## Plugin Management

Plugins are managed from the Plugins admin screen of your WordPress site.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WgkAR2VYH-J9UuWIL5qIpwLjBIEnxSGVjE5Njfss-2UOc0KGhMMWiRgFbyZjuVi8KG1ZvjUt5JaGUZD3ZSDJKTvsabKaVG7JNAVw-8QHMHHqplQUwsSGURdFTvxQgH2IhQ_mtZ4s)Here you will find a list of all installed plugins, whether they are active or inactive. From this screen, you can activate, deactivate and delete plugins.

Plugins listed in bold are currently active.

Each plugin on the list also contains links to further information about the plugin.

### **Must-Use Plugins**

Must-use plugins (a.k.a. mu-plugins) are plugins installed in a special directory inside the content folder and which are automatically enabled.

Must-use plugins do not show in the default list of plugins on the Plugins page and cannot be disabled except by removing the plugin file from the must-use directory, which is found in wp-content/mu-plugins by default.

For more details, please refer [Must Use Plugins](#documentation/article/must-use-plugins).

## Developing Plugins

The WordPress community relies on plugin developers to maintain a healthy and growing collection of plugins. A large part of what makes WordPress valuable is the extensive and freely available plugins.

You can help WordPress users by creating your own plugins for distribution through the WordPress plugin directory.

You can get started with the WordPress plugin development using the resources in the [WordPress Plugin Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/).

# Manage WordPress widgets <a name="documentation/article/manage-wordpress-widgets" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-wordpress-widgets/

This article covers âClassic Widgetsâ. If you are using the newer block-based widgets, please check [this article](#documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor).

WordPress widgets add content and functionality to the widget area. The widget area is a pre-defined area by the theme, typically located in the sidebar or footer, but varies from theme to theme. Examples are the default widgets that come with WordPress; for Categories, Tag cloud, Search, etc. Plugins will often add their own widgets.

Widgets were originally designed to provide a simple and easy-to-use way of giving design and structure control of the WordPress Theme to the user, which is now available on properly âwidgetizedâ WordPress Themes to include the header, footer, and elsewhere in the WordPress design and structure.

Widgets require no code experience or expertise. They can be added, removed, and rearranged on the **Theme Customizer** or **Appearance &gt; Widgets** in the WordPress Administration Screens.

Some WordPress Widgets offer customization and options such as forms to fill out, includes or excludes of data and information, optional images, and other customization features.

The [Block-based Widgets Editor](#documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor) explains how to use the updated Widgets experience with blocks.

The [Appearance Widgets Screen](#documentation/article/appearance-widgets-screen) explains how to use the various Widgets that come with WordPress in the Classic experience.

Plugins that come bundled with widgets can be found in the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#extend/plugins).

## Installing Widgets

WordPress comes pre-packaged with a variety of [Widgets](/support/article/glossary/#widget). If those are insufficient for your needs you can install new ones by searching the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#extend/plugins) which is accessible from the WordPress Administration **Plugins &gt; Add New** Screen.

## Displaying Widgets

### Existing Widgets in Existing Widget Areas

Before you can add a Widget you must verify that the Theme youâre using supports Widgets (more specifically: [Widget Area](/support/article/glossary/#widget-area)). You can do so by simply navigating to the Appearance menu and looking for a sub menu titled âWidgetsâ.

If your Theme supports Theme Customizer then you can use the following Steps. In Theme Customizer, the live preview of changes is available.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/appearance-customize-widgets.png)1. Go to **Appearance &gt; Customize** in the WordPress Administration Screens.
2. Click the **Widget** menu in the Theme Customizer to access to the Widget Customize Screen.
3. Click the **down arrow** of Widget Area to list the already registered Widgets.
4. Click Add a Widget button at the bottom of sidebar. It shows the list of available widgets.
5. Click a widget you want to add. The widgets should be added in the sidebar.
6. Preview your site and you should see the content from your new Widget.
7. To arrange the Widgets within the Sidebar, drag and drop the widgets in the order you want or click Reorder link and click up arrow and down allow of each widget and click Done after the arrange operation.
8. To customize the Widget features, click the **down arrow** in the right to expand the Widgetâs interface.
9. To remove the widget, click **Remove** from Widgetâs interface in above step.

If your Theme does not support Theme Customizer then you can use the following conventional steps:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/designwidget-2.png)1. Go to **Appearance &gt; Widgets** in the WordPress Administration Screens.
2. Choose a Widget and either drag it to the sidebar where you wish it to appear, or click the widget, (select a destination sidebar if your theme has more than one) and click the Add Widget button. There might be more than one sidebar option, so begin with the first one. Once in place, WordPress automatically updates the Theme.
3. Preview the site. You should find that the âdefaultâ sidebar elements are now gone and only the new addition is visible.
4. Return to the Widgets Screen to continue adding Widgets.
5. To arrange the Widgets within the sidebar or Widget area, click and drag it into place.
6. To customize the Widget features, click the down arrow in the upper right corner to expand the Widgetâs interface.
7. To save the Widgetâs customization, click Save.
8. To remove the Widget, click Delete.

If you want to remove the widget but save its setting for possible future use, just drag it into the Inactive Widgets area. You can add them back anytime from there. This is especially helpful when you switch to a theme with fewer or different widget areas.

When changing themes, there is often some variation in the number and setup of widget areas/sidebars and sometimes these conflicts make the transition a bit less smooth. If you changed themes and seem to be missing widgets, scroll down on the screen to the Inactive Widgets area, where all of your widgets and their settings will have been saved.

Enabling Accessibility Mode, via Screen Options, allows you to use Add and Edit buttons instead of using drag and drop.

### Widget Areas

While widget areas typically occur in webpage sidebars, a theme can place widget areas anywhere on a page. For example, besides the usual sidebar locations, the [Twenty Seventeen](/support/article/twenty-seventeen/) theme has a widget area in the footer of every page.

## Using Text Widgets

The Text Widget is one of the most commonly used WordPress Widgets that comes with every WordPress installation. It allows users to add text, video, images, custom lists, and more to their WordPress sites.

To use the WordPress Text Widget:

1. Go to **Appearance &gt; Customize** in the WordPress Administration Screens and click the **Widget** menu in the Theme Customizer. Or Go to **Appearance &gt; Widgets** in the WordPress Administration Screens.
2. Open the sidebar to which you wish to add the Text Widget.
3. Find the Text Widget in the list of Widgets.
4. Click and drag the Widget to the spot you wish it to appear.

To open and edit the Text Widget:

1. Click the down arrow to the right of the Text Widget title.
2. Set the Text Widget Title (optional).
3. Add the text or HTML code to the box or edit what is currently there.
4. Choose the option to **Automatically add paragraphs** to wrap each block of text in an HTML paragraph tag (recommended for text).
5. Click Save to save the Text Widget.
6. Click Close to close the Text Widget.
7. Switch tabs in your browser and preview the results and make changes if necessary.

The Text Widget can hold a variety of HTML, XHTML, and multimedia links and players such as video and object embeds.

### Adding Code to the Text Widget

Basic HTML, embeds, and JavaScript are added easily to the WordPress Text Widget. Most embed codes from social sharing sites for multimedia will work in a WordPress Text Widget. However, active code and programming languages such as PHP will not work as the Widget will strip out code it cannot display.

To add active code to the Text Widget, use one of the many WordPress Plugins from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins) that override WordPress restrictions on using PHP in posts. Check that they will work on Widgets as some will not.

## Using RSS Widgets

The RSS Widget allows you to integrate an external feed source for content into a Widget area of your site, such as your Twitter account, Facebook posts, Google+ posts, or other blogs.

The RSS Widget displays the most recently published content from any source with an active feed. This is an ideal way of integrating outside content into your site.

By default, WordPress RSS Widget displays the post title or the first 100 or so characters of a Tweet or long untitled post. These are either in the form of a link or features a link to the original source depending upon the feedâs design and structure.

1. Enter the RSS feed URL in the first box, copied from the source page for the content you wish to include in your sidebar or other widgetized space.
2. Give the feed a title: This is optional and gives you the chance to showcase the source of the content.

## What is a Theme?

Fundamentally, the WordPress Theme system is a way to âskinâ your WordPress site. Yet, it is more than just a âskinâ. Skinning your site implies that only the design is changed. WordPress Themes can provide much more control over the visual presentation of your content and other data on your WordPress site, as well as behavior of certain siteâs elements while interacting with visitors.

A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a website. These files are called [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/). A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (\*.jpg, \*.png, \*.gif), style sheets (\*.css), custom [Pages](/support/article/pages/), as well as any necessary code files (\*.php). For an introduction to template files, see [Template Files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/).

Letâs say you write a lot about cheese and gadgets. Through the use of the [WordPress Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/) and [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/), you can customize your Cheese category posts to look different from your Gadgets category posts. With this powerful control over what different pages and categories look like on your site, you are limited only by your imagination. For information on how to create custom look for various templates in your theme, take a look at [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).

## Default Themes

WordPress currently comes with twelve themes: the default [Twenty Twenty Two theme](#themes/twentytwentytwo) ([demo](https://2022.wordpress.net/)), and the previous defaults [Twenty Twenty One theme](#themes/twentytwentyone) ([demo](https://2021.wordpress.net/)) [Twenty Twenty](#documentation/article/twenty-twenty) ([demo](http://2020.wordpress.net/)) [Twenty Nineteen](#documentation/article/twenty-nineteen) ([demo](http://2019.wordpress.net/)) [Twenty Seventeen](#documentation/article/twenty-seventeen) ([demo](http://2017.wordpress.net/)) [Twenty Sixteen](#documentation/article/twenty-sixteen) ([demo](https://twentysixteendemo.wordpress.com/)) [Twenty Fifteen](#documentation/article/twenty-fifteen) ([demo](https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/)) [Twenty Fourteen](#themes/twentyfourteen) ([demo](https://twentyfourteendemo.wordpress.com/)) [Twenty Thirteen](#themes/twentythirteen) ([demo](https://twentythirteendemo.wordpress.com/)) [Twenty Twelve](#themes/twentytwelve) ([demo](https://twentytwelvedemo.wordpress.com/)) [Twenty Eleven](#themes/twentyeleven) ([demo](https://twentyelevendemo.wordpress.com/)) [Twenty Ten](#themes/twentyten) ([demo](https://twentytendemo.wordpress.com/)).

The Twenty Twenty Two theme is the first ever default [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes). It currently only works if you are using WordPress 5.9 and above or if you install the Gutenberg plugin alongside prior WordPress versions.

***NOTE***: All default themes now come bundled with [block patterns](#documentation/article/block-pattern), which allow you to easily create beautiful layouts. Find out which patterns are added to themes on the [Make WordPress Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/21/bundled-themes-changes-in-wordpress-5-8/).

You can switch between Themes from the Appearance menu in the Administration Screen. Themes you add to the theme directory will appear in the [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) &gt; [Themes](/support/article/administration-screens/#themes) as additional selections.

[![Themes Administration Screen - Installed Themes](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/themes-administration-screen-1024x503.png)](#documentation/files/2021/06/themes-administration-screen.png)Themes Administration Screen â Installed Themes## Get New Themes

The [WordPress Theme Directory](#themes) is the official site for WordPress Themes. Every theme in this directory is reviewed by a dedicated team and tested against wide range of rules, all of which are ensuring secure and pleasant experience for theme user.

With over 9,000 themes in the directory, you can easily find the right one for your site with advanced search feature using filters for layout, subject and specific themeâs features. This includes finding [Block themes](#documentation/article/block-themes) which support full site editing features.

[![Themes Directory - Feature Filter](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/themes-feature-filter.png)](#documentation/article/using-themes/themes-feature-filter-2)Themes Directory â Feature FilterIf you need more than a screenshot and features list to decide whether the theme fits your needs, you can see the demo for the theme with **Preview** feature on [themeâs info page](#themes/twentytwentyone).

![Twenty Twenty-One Theme Info Page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/theme-info-page.png)Theme Info Page## Adding New Themes

Most of themes in [WordPress Theme Directory](#themes) come with installation instructions, especially the ones that may require more steps than the usual theme installation. Be sure to read through and follow those instructions for the successful installation of the Theme. If your Theme does not work after following any provided instructions, please **contact the Theme author for help**.

### Adding Block themes

A [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) is a theme that uses blocks for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer. These themes are built for the newest features coming to WordPress that allow you to edit and customize all parts of your site.

Currently, you can add block themes in the same way you would any other theme. However, the Live Preview option is removed which means you will need to [set up a test site](#documentation/article/test-driving-wordpress) first to explore the theme before activating if you wish to preview it. You also will not have the option to use the Customizer since block themes rely on the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor) to edit all parts of your site. In order to customize a block theme, youâll need to activate it first.

You can [read more about this current experience here](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/07/state-of-the-customizer-with-block-themes-in-wordpress-5-9/).

### Adding New Themes using the Administration Screens

You can download any theme from [WordPress Theme Directory](#themes) directly to your site by using the **Add New** option in the Appearance sub-menu.

1. Log in to the WordPress [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/).
2. Select the [Appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) screen, then [Themes](/support/article/administration-screens/#themes).
3. Select **Add New**.
4. Either use the **Search** or **Filter options** to locate a Theme you would like to use.
5. Click on the **Preview** link to preview the Theme or the **Install** link to upload the Theme to your site. Note that
6. Or use the **Upload Theme** button at the top of page to upload a zipped copy of a Theme that you have previously downloaded to your machine.

When the Theme is already downloaded but not activated **Live Preview** option will give you a preview of your site with your own, existing content.

### Adding New Themes by using cPanel

If your host offers the [cPanel](/support/article/glossary/#cpanel) control panel, you can use its **Upload** option to upload the Theme files to your site. For this you will need Theme files in an compressed archive (**.zip** or **.gz**).

1. Download the Theme **.zip** file to your machine.
2. In **cPanel File Manager**, navigate to your **Themes folder**. Depending on your hosting, path to Themes folder can differ a bit but essentially you are looking for **public\_html** inside which youâll find **/wp-content/themes/**.
3. Once youâre inside the **Themes folder** in cPanel File Manager, click on **Upload** and upload that **.zip** file you saved in Step 1.
4. Once the **.zip** file is uploaded, **right click** on the name of that file in cPanel and select **Extract** from the context menu.
5. When Theme files are successfully extracted, follow the [instructions below](#activating-the-theme) for activating the new Theme.

 [![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/cpanel-file-manager-300x61.jpg)](#documentation/cpanel-file-manager)

  cPanel â Themes Directory  

### Adding New Themes Manually (FTP)

To add a new Theme to your WordPress installation via FTP protocol, youâll need [FTP client](/support/article/ftp-clients/) and extracted Theme files.

1. Download the Theme archive (**.zip**) and extract the files it contains. You should have a folder named as theme itself, containing theme files.
2. Using an [FTP cli](/getting-started/ftp-clients/)[e](/support/article/ftp-clients/)[nt](/getting-started/ftp-clients/) to access your host web server and navigate to **/wp-content/themes/** directory.
3. Upload the Theme folder to this directory on your host server.
4. Follow the [instructions below](#activating-the-theme) for activating the new Theme.

## Activating the Theme

Now that new Theme is in **/wp-content/themes/** directory (whether you used [Administration Screens](#adding-new-themes-using-the-administration-screens), [cPanel](#adding-new-themes-by-using-cpanel) or [FTP](#adding-new-themes-manually-ftp) method), this new Theme is ready to be activated. All themes in **/wp-content/themes/** directory are available for **Activation** and **Update** (when update is provided by theme author), but only one theme from this directory can be **Active**.

When theme is **Activated** it means that this themeâs style and functionality (look and behavior) will be applied on your site. You will be informed by Administration notification about successful activation of the Theme.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/theme-activated-notice.jpg)Activated Theme NoticeTo activate a Theme for your site:

1. Log in to the WordPress [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/).
2. Select the [Appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) screen, then [Themes](/support/article/administration-screens/#themes).
3. You should see here all themes from your **/wp-content/themes/** directory and from here you can see details for each of them by clicking on **Theme Details** (rollover the Theme thumbnail).
4. **Live Preview** option will give you preview of your site with your siteâs content.
5. To activate the Theme click the **Activate** button.

Your selection will immediately become active.

**Note:** If the Theme preview is blank, do **NOT** activate the new Theme without investigating further. Your site may not be displayed correctly, otherwise. If you do not see Themeâs thumbnail at all, your new Theme might be corrupted or broken. Take a look below installed themeâs thumbnails if there is any info about broken themes. In this case **contact the Theme author for help**.

# FAQ My site was hacked <a name="documentation/article/faq-my-site-was-hacked" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-my-site-was-hacked/

## Help I think Iâve been hacked

Suffering a hack can be one of the more frustrating experiences youâll have on your online journey. Like most things however, taking a pragmatic approach can help you maintain your sanity. While also moving beyond the issues with as little impact as possible.

A hack is a very ambiguous term, which in it of itself will provide little insights into what exactly happened. To ensure you get the help you need via the forums, be sure to understand the specific symptoms that lead you to believe youâve been hacked. These are otherwise known as Indicators of Compromise (IoC).

A couple of IoCâs that are clear indicators of a hack include:

- Website is blacklisted by Google, Bing, etc..
- Host has disabled your website
- Website has been flagged for distributing malware
- Readers complaining that their desktop AVâs are flagging your site
- Contacted that your website is being used to attack other sites
- Notice behavior that was not authorized (i.e., creation of new users, etcâ¦)
- You can visibly see that your site has been hacked when you open it in the browser

Not all hacks are created equal, so when engaging in the forums please keep this in mind. If you can better understand the symptoms the teams will be better equipped to provide help.

Below you will find a series of steps that are designed to help you start working through the post-hack process. They are not all encompassing as it would be impractical to account for every scenario, but they are designed to help you think through the process.

## Some steps to take

**Stay calm.**

When addressing a security issue, as a website owner, youâre likely experiencing an undue amount of stress. Itâs often the most vulnerable you have found yourself since being on line and itâs contrary to what every one told you, âHey, WordPress is Easy!!â

The good news is that all is not lost! Yes, you might lose some money. Yes, you might take a hit against your brand. Yes, you will recover from this.

So, yes, take a step back and compose yourself. Doing so will allow you to more effectively take control of the situation and allow you to recover your online presence.

**Document.**

The first actionable step you should take post-compromise is documentation. Take a moment to document what youâre experiencing, and if possible times. A couple of things you want to keep in mind:

- What are you seeing that leads you to believe you are hacked?
- What time did you notice this issue? What timezone?
- What actions have you taken recently? Was a new plugin installed? Did you make a change to a theme? Modify a widget?

You are creating the baseline for what is recognized as an incident report. Whether you are planning to perform the incident response yourself, or engage a professional organization, this document will prove invaluable over time.

Recommend taking a moment to annotate details of your host environment as well. It will be required at some point during the incident response process.

**Scan your website.**

When scanning your website you have a few different ways to do this, you can use external remote scanners or application level scanners. Each are designed to look and report on different things. No one solution is the best approach, but together you improve your odds greatly.

Application Based Scanners (Plugins):

- [Quttera](#plugins/quttera-web-malware-scanner)
- [GOTMLS](#plugins/gotmls)
- [WordFence](#plugins/wordfence)
- [Sucuri](#plugins/sucuri-scanner)

Remote Based Scanners (Crawlers):

- [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/)
- [Sitecheck](https://sitecheck.sucuri.net)

There are also a number of other related security [plugins](#plugins/search.php) available in the WP repo. The ones annotated above have been around a long time and have strong communities behind each of them.

**Scan your local environment.**

In addition to scanning your website, you should start scanning your local environment. In many instances, the source of the attack / infection begins on your local box (i.e., notebook, desktop, etcâ¦). Attackers are running trojans locally that allow them to sniff login access information to things like FTP and /wp-admin that allow them to log in as the site owner.

Make sure you run a full anti-virus/malware scan on your local machine. Some viruses are good at detecting AV software and hiding from them. So maybe try a different one. This advice extends to both Windows, OS X and Linux machines.

**Check with your hosting provider.**

The hack may have affected more than just your site, especially if you are using shared hosting. It is worth checking with your hosting provider in case they are taking steps or need to. Your hosting provider might also be able to confirm if a hack is an actual hack or a loss of service, for example.

One very serious implication of a hack these days is around Email blacklisting. This seems to be happening more and more. As websites are abused to send out SPAM emails, Email Blacklist authorities are flagging the website IPâs and those IPâs are often associated with the same server being used for email. The best thing you can do is look at Email providers like [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/index.html) when it comes to your business needs.

**Be Mindful of Website Blacklists.**

[Google Blacklist](https://sucuri.net/guides/what-is-google-blocklist) issues can be detrimental to your brand. They currently blacklist somewhere in the neighborhood of 9,500 to 10,000 websites a day. This number grows daily. There are various forms of warnings, from large splash pages warning users to stay away, to more subtle warnings that pop up in your Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs).

Although Google is one of the more prominent ones, there are a number of other blacklist entities like Bing, Yahoo and a wide range of Desktop AntiVirus applications. Understand that your clients / website visitors may leverage any number of tools and any one of them could be causing the issue.

Itâs recommended that you register your site with the various online webmaster consoles like:

- [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/)
- [Bing Webmaster](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster)
- [Yandex Webmaster](https://webmaster.yandex.com/)
- [Norton Webmaster](https://safeweb.norton.com/tags/show?tag=WebMaster)

**Improve your Access Controls.**

You will often hear folks talking about updating things like Passwords. Yes, this is a very important piece, but itâs one small piece in a much larger problem. We need improve our overall posture when it comes to access control. This means using Complex, Long and Unique passwords for starters. The best recommendation is to use a Password Generator like those found in apps like [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) and [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/).

Remember that this includes changing all access points. When we say access points we mean things like FTP / SFTP, WP-ADMIN, CPANEL (or any other administrator panel you use with your host) and MYSQL.

This also extends beyond your user, and must include all users that have access to the environment.

It is also recommended to consider using some form of [Two Factor / Multi-Factor authentication system](https://halfelf.org/2013/two-factor-authentication/). In itâs most basic form, it introduces, and requires, a second form of authentication when logging into your WordPress instance.

Some of the plugins available to assist you with this include:

- [Rublon](#plugins/rublon)
- [Duo](#plugins/duo-wordpress)

**Reset all Access.**

Once you identify a hack, one of the first steps you will want to do is lock things down so that you can minimize any additional changes. The first place to start is with your users. You can do this by forcing a global password reset for all users, especially administrators.

Here is a plugin that can assist with this step:

- [iThemes Security](#plugins/better-wp-security)

You also want to clear any users that might be actively logged into WordPress. You do this by updating the secret keys in wp-config. You will need to create a new set here: [the WordPress key generator](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/). Take those values then [overwrite the values in your wp-config.php file](#documentation/article/editing-wp-config-php) with the new ones. This will force anyone that might still be logged in off.

**Create a Backup.**

You hopefully have a backup of your website, but if you donât, this will be a good time to [create one](#documentation/article/wordpress-backups). Backups are a critical piece of your continuation of operations, and should be something you actively plan for moving forward. You should also ask your host what their policy is as it pertains to backups. If you do have a backup, you should be able to perform a restore and skill right into the forensics work.

Side note: Itâs important you keep regular backups of your [database](#documentation/article/backing-up-your-database) and [files](#documentation/article/backing-up-your-wordpress-files). If this ever happens again.

Regardless, before you move into the next phase of cleaning, it is recommended you take one more snapshot of the environment. Even if itâs infected, depending on the type of hack, the impacts can cause a lot of issues and in the event of catastrophic failure youâll at least have that bad copy to reference.

**Find and remove the hack.**

This will be the most daunting part of the entire process. Finding and removing the hack. The exact steps you take will be dictated by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the symptoms provided above. How you approach the problem will be determined by your own technical aptitude working with websites and web servers.

To help in the process though, weâve included a number of different resources that should help you in the process:

- [Did Your WordPress Site Get Hacked?](http://ocaoimh.ie/did-your-wordpress-site-get-hacked/)
- [How to Clean Your Hacked Install](http://smackdown.blogsblogsblogs.com/2008/06/24/how-to-completely-clean-your-hacked-wordpress-installation/)
- [How To Clean a Hacked WordPress Site](https://sucuri.net/guides/how-to-clean-hacked-wordpress)
- [How to Cope With a Hacked Site](http://ottopress.com/2011/how-to-cope-with-a-hacked-site/)
- [Four Malware Infections](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/four-malware-infections-wordpress/)
- [How to Clean a WordPress Hack](https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/)

It might be tempting to purge everything and start over. In some cases thatâs possible, but in many instances itâs just not possible. What you can do however is reinstall certain elements of the site with little regard to impacting the core of your website. You always want to make sure you reinstall the same version of software your website is using, if you choose an older or newer one youâre likely to kill your website. When reinstalling, be sure not to use the reinstall options in your WP-ADMIN. Use your FTP / SFTP application to drag and drop the versions. This will prove much more effective in the long run as those installers often only overwrite existing files, and hacks often introduce new filesâ¦ You can replace the following directories safely:

- /wp-admin
- /wp-includes

From there, itâs recommended that you be more diligent in updating and replacing files as you move through wp-content as it contains your theme and plugin files.

The one file you will definitely want to look at is your .htaccess file. Itâs one of the more common files, regardless of the type of infection, that is most often updated and used for nefarious activities. This file is often located at the root of your installation folder, but can also be embedded within several other directories on the same installation.

Regardless of the type of infection, there are will be some common files you will want to keep an eye on during your remediation process. They include:

- index.php
- header.php
- footer.php
- function.php

If modified, these files can usually adversely affect all page requests, making them high targets for bad actors.

**Leverage the Community**

We often forget but weâre a community based platform, this means that if youâre in trouble someone in the community is likely to give a lending hand. A very good place to start if youâre strapped for cash or just looking for a helping hand is the [WordPress.org Hacked](#tags/hacked) or [Malware](#tags/malware) forum.

**Update!**

Once you are clean, you should [update your WordPress installation](#documentation/article/updating-wordpress) to the [latest software](#download). Older versions are more prone to hacks than newer versions.

**Change the passwords again!**

Remember, you need to change the passwords for your site *after* making sure your site is clean. So if you only changed them when you discovered the hack, [change them again now](#documentation/article/resetting-your-password). Again remembering to use Complex, Long and Unique passwords.

You may consider to change the database user account and password. When you changed them, do not forget enhancing them to wp-config.php file.

**Forensics.**

Forensics is the process of understanding what happened. How did the attackers get in? The goal is to understand the attack vector a bad actor used to ensure theyâre unable to abuse it again. In many instances, itâs very difficult for website owners to perform this type of analysis due to lack of technical knowledge and / or available data. If you do have the metadata required, then there are tools like like [OSSEC](http://www.ossec.net) and [splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) that can help you synthesize the data.

**Secure your site.**

Now that you have successfully recovered your site, secure it by implementing some (if not all) of the [recommended security measures](#documentation/article/hardening-wordpress).

**Canât Log Into WordPress Admin Panel**

There are times that a bad actor will hijack your administrator account\[s\]. This is not a reason to panic, there are a few different things you can do to regain control of your account. You can follow these steps to [reset your password](#documentation/article/resetting-your-password)

Tools like [phpMyAdmin](#documentation/article/phpmyadmin) and [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) are often made available via your hosting provider. They allow you to log into your database directly, bypassing your [Administration Screen](#documentation/article/administration-screens) and resetting your user in the users table `wp_users`.

If you donât want to mess with password hashes or canât figure it out, simply update your email and go back to Login Screen, click forgot password, and wait for the email.

**Using version control?**

If you are using version control, it can be very handy to quickly identify what has changed and to rollback to a previous version of the website. From the terminal or command line you can compare your files with the versions stored in the official WordPress repository.

$` svn diff .`

Or compare a specific file:

$` svn diff /path/to/filename`

# Password Best Practices <a name="documentation/article/password-best-practices" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/password-best-practices/

Securing your WordPress starts with a strong password. A strong password is complex and elaborate. It isnât easy to guess since it doesnât contain recognizable words, names, dates or numbers. You shouldnât pick a password containing less than 20 characters. It can be hard though to remember a random string of letters, numbers and special characters. But in general, the more characters and complexity, the better.

Here are some suggested guidelines when creating a strong password:

- At least 20 characters (preferably more)
- Use lowercase and uppercase
- Containing numbers
- Containing special characters such as ``!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_{}|~```

## More about special characters

- a backslash `\` is not allowed
- many typographical characters like elegant quotes, ligatures, letters with accents and mathematical symbols are allowed (by WordPress) in passwords, but not recommended. Some characters are hard to recognize. Many characters are harder or sometimes impossible to type on a device. The characters can not be substituted by simpler version, it has to be exactly that character
- a space is allowed, but not recommended at the start of a password

**Example**

A good password that upholds all of the guidelines above could be:

`As32!KoP43??@ZkI??L0d`

## Things you should absolutely avoid

Names or words that can be easily linked to you:

- The name of your partner or kids
- The name of your pet
- The name of your company
- The name of your favorite sports team or car brand
- The year in which you were born
- Your birthday

All these items are personal (mostly public) information and thus possible risks for social engineering. So avoid these at all costs!

**Example**

- If your name is John Rogers and you were born in 1976, `JohnRogers1976` would be a really bad idea for a password.

Generic password elements:

- Number sequences like â123â or â54321â
- Using generic words like âadminâ, âadministratorâ, âpassâ, âpasswordâ, âblueâ, âhouseââ¦

These elements are often the first terms that are used by malicious people or software when attempting to brute force your password, so should be avoided!

**Example**

Obviously, the password examples below are horrible passwords and NOT SECURE:

- MattMullenweg2018
- admin123
- Password1!

You should also avoid using the same password on multiple sites or accounts.

## Automatically generated passwords in WordPress

When you make a new account for your site or reset your password, a password will be suggested for you (or you can use the button âGenerate passwordâ). These strong passwords contain 24 characters, numbers, letters, capitals, and special characters.

## Keeping track of your passwords

Since complex passwords are a real necessity these days, it can be a real burden to remember every single password. Fortunately, password managers can help users keep track of their different passwords without resorting to using the same password on multiple sites. Password managers act as a vault for your passwords, secured by one (complex) master password. Many also have functionality to automatically (or on your command) enter your stored password for you, via browser extensions or desktop applications. Using a password manager means you only need to remember your one master password to access all of your other passwords.

A list of password managers and their features is available on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_password\_managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers). Most browsers can store and synchronize your accounts and passwords.

## Other security recommendations

### Two factor authentication

Another great way to keep your WordPress acess more secure is to set up two factor authentication (2FA). Currently, this requires installation of a third-party plugin. To set up 2FA look for plugins in the plugins directory with tags like â2FAâ, âtwo factor authenticationâ, or âtwo stepâ.

### Usernames

A common method of brute force hacking is to use a âdictionaryâ of common username and password combinations. For this reason, it is often recommended to avoid common usernames such as âadminâ.

## Changelog

- Created 2018-10-27
- Updated 2023-05-23 with additional recommendations on automatically generated passwords, 2FA and Usernames, and minor grammatical/clarity modifications.

# Assign custom fields <a name="documentation/article/assign-custom-fields" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/assign-custom-fields/

WordPress has the ability to allow post authors to assign custom fields to a post. This arbitrary extra information is known as **metadata**. This **metadata** can include bits of information such as:

- **Mood:** Happy
- **Currently Reading:** Cinderella
- **Listening To:** Rock Around the Clock
- **Weather:** Hot and humid

With some extra coding, it is possible to achieve more complex actions, such as using the **metadata** to store an expiration date for a post.

Metadata is handled with **key/value** pairs. The **key** is the name of the metadata element. The **value** is the information that will appear in the metadata list on each individual post that the information is associated with.

**Keys** can be used more than once per post. For example, if you were reading two different books (perhaps a technical book at work and a fiction at home), you could create a âreadingâ key and use it twice on the same post, once for each book.

Here is an example of what this information might look like on your post:

```
<strong>Currently Reading</strong>: <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em><br></br><strong>Today's Mood</strong>: <em>Jolly and Happy</em>
```

## Usage

Based upon our example above, letâs add two custom fields, one called âCurrently Readingâ and the other âTodayâs Moodâ. Please follow the below steps to add this information to a post using Custom Fields.

1. Custom Fields options on the Post &amp; Page edit screens are hidden by default if they have not been used before. Using the Block Editor, click the three dots button at the top of the right sidebar and visit **Options** to enable it. (If you are using the Classic editor, check the [screen options](#documentation/article/administration-screens)).
2. After you have written your post, scroll down to the area titled **Custom Fields**.
3. To create a new **Custom Field** called âCurrently Readingâ, enter the text âCurrently Readingâ (without the quotes) in the text entry field titled **Name**.
4. The newly created **Key** (âCurrently Readingâ) should now be assigned a **Value**, which in our case is the name of the book currently being read, âCalvin and Hobbesâ. Type âCalvin and Hobbesâ in the *Value* field, again without the quotes.
5. Click **Add Custom Field** button to save this custom information for that post.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/custom_field_example.jpg)Custom FieldsTo add your âTodayâs Moodâ, repeat the process and add âTodayâs Moodâ to the **key** and a description of your mood in the **value** text boxes and click **Add Custom Field** to save this information with the post.

On your next post, you can add a new book and mood to your metadata. In the **Custom Fields** section, the **Key** will now feature a pull-down list with the previously entered Custom Fields. Choose âCurrently Readingâ and then enter the new book you are reading in the **value**. Click **Add Custom Field** and then repeat the process to add âTodayâs Moodâ.

You only need to create a new âKEYâ **once**, after which you can assign a value to that key for every post, if you so desire. You can also assign more than one *Value* to a key, for a post. This will come in handy for people who read more than one book at a time.

## Displaying Custom Fields

To display the Custom Fields for each post, you have to use a template tag that customizes your theme. For more details about it, please refer to:

- [the\_meta() ](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_meta/)â Template tag that automatically lists all Custom Fields of a post
- [get\_post\_custom()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_custom/) and [get\_post\_meta()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_meta/) â Retrieves one or all metadata of a post.
- [get\_post\_custom\_values()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_post_custom_values/) â Retrieves values for a custom post field.
- [Template Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-tags/) â WordPress Theme Developers Handbook page on Template Tags

You may install a plugin that manages custom fields by searching â[custom fields](#plugins/search/custom+fields)â in the plugins directory.

# What is Post Type? <a name="documentation/article/what-is-post-type" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-is-post-type/

WordPress houses lots of different types of content and they are divided into something called ***Post Typesï»¿***. A single item is called a ***post*** however this is also the name of a standard post type called ***posts***. By default WordPress comes with a few different post types which are all stored in the database under the ***wp\_posts*** table.

## Default Post Types

The default post types that are always included within a WordPress installation unless otherwise removed are:

- Posts
- Pages
- Attachments
- Revisions
- Navigation Menus
- Custom CSS
- Changesets

### Posts

A ***post*** in WordPress is a *post type* that is typical for, and most used by blogs. *Posts* are normally displayed in a blog in reverse sequential order by time (newest posts first). Posts are also used for creating RSS feeds.

### Pages

A page is similar to posts however they have some very important differences. Pages arenât displayed in a reversed time-based order. They can also be placed into a hierarchical order where a page can be the parent or child of another page creating a page structure. Traditionally, pages also do not make use of categories and tags like posts do.

### Attachments

Attachments are another post type that is special as these hold information about any media that is uploaded to your WordPress website. Not only is the main post information stored where other posts are, attachments also make use of the wp\_postmeta table for storing extra information like metadata for images and videos that youâve added.

### Revisions

Revisions are a particularly special post type as they are used to create a history of other post types in case you make a mistake and want to rollback to a previous version. Whilst you technically canât edit revisions directly unless you restore a revision, they are editable just like posts and are stored in the ***wp\_posts*** table like any other post type.

### Menus

Menus in WordPress are lists of links that can be used to navigate your website. This allows you to create custom lists of links to various locations on your website that is used by your visitors and are edited in the theme section of the dashboard away from traditional post types like posts or pages.

### Custom CSS

Custom CSSï»¿ is a theme specific post type used to store CSS saved from The Customizers ***Additional CSS*** screen. Each theme can have its own custom CSS post but only the active themes `custom\_css` post is actually used.

### Changesets

Changesets are similar to revisions but specifically for the Customizer. This is to keep the Customizer in a persistent state. WordPress will attempt to keep content changes made through the Customizer during the user session in a `customize\_changeset` post and attempt to restore them should you exit your current session.

## Custom Post Types

Whilst there are already lots of standard post types within WordPress, you may want to extend the amount of post types you have if you want to break things down into smaller categories. For example, if you want to have a section on Books, it would be better suited to creating a custom post type for them. This can be done using the [register\_post\_type](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_type/) function.

Itâs highly recommended that you define custom post types within a plugin or must-use plugin to ensure that if you switch themes, the post type isnât lost. That way you can ensure your content is always accessible.

## Template Files

By default WordPress makes use of the index.php, single.php and archive.php files in a theme to display posts of any type of the front-end of a website. However, if youâve made a custom post type, you may find that you want to show this information in a different way to other types. You can do this by using post type specific [custom templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/custom-post-type-template-files/) within your theme.

If you create a post type called Books like in the example above, you can create a template file called single-books.php which will show the individual book posts that you publish. Again, to show all your books in a custom archive page (where they are all listed), you can create an archive-books.php template file and this will show all the book posts that youâve published.

## Post Type Queries

In the event that you want to get a list of your custom posts called Books, you can create a new [WP\_Query](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/) instance and fetch them all. This is handy if you want to create a custom loop somewhere on your website and show them in a different way to other posts.

## The Posts Query

You might find that in some cases you want to include custom posts into your main query of blog posts. You can do this by using the [pre\_get\_posts](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/pre_get_posts/) filter hook which lets you customize the query that gets your posts before itâs shown on the front-end of the website.

# Updating WordPress <a name="documentation/article/updating-wordpress" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/updating-wordpress/

**WARNING:** The upgrade process will affect all files and folders included in the main WordPress installation. This includes all the core files used to run WordPress. If you have made any modifications to those files, your changes will be lost.

You should always update WordPress to the [latest version](#download). When a new version of WordPress is available you will receive an update message in your WordPress Admin Screens. To update WordPress, click the link in this message.

There are two methods for updating â the easiest is the one-click update, which will work for most people. If it doesnât work, or you just prefer to be more hands-on, you can follow the manual update process.

If you are updating across multiple versions, follow the procedure at [Upgrading WordPress â Extended Instructions](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/upgrading/)

## Back up WordPress

Before you get started, itâs a good idea to back up your website. This means if there are any issues you can restore your website. Complete instructions to make a backup can be found in the [WordPress Backup](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/security/backup/).

## Automatic Background Updates

For [WordPress 3.7](#documentation/wordpress-version/version-3-7)+, you donât have to lift a finger to apply minor and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. If your site is capable of one-click updates without entering FTP credentials, then your site should be able to update from 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.7.2, etc. (Youâll still need to click âUpdate Nowâ for major feature releases.)

## One-click Update

WordPress lets you update with the click of a button. You can launch the update by clicking the link in the new version banner (if itâs there) or by going to the Dashboard &gt; Updates screen. Once you are on the âUpdate WordPressâ page, click the button âUpdate Nowâ to start the process off. You shouldnât need to do anything else and, once itâs finished, you will be up-to-date.

One-click updates work on most servers. If you have any problems, it is probably related to permissions issues on the filesystem.

### File Ownership

WordPress determines what method it will use to connect to the filesystem of your server based on the file ownership of your WordPress files. If the files are owned by the owner of the current process (i.e., the user under which the web server is running), *and* new files created by WordPress will also be owned by that user, WordPress will directly modify the files all by itself, without asking you for credentials.

WordPress wonât attempt to create the new files directly if they wonât have the correct ownership. Instead, you will be shown a dialog box asking for connection credentials. It is typical for the files to be owned by the FTP account that originally uploaded them. To perform the update, you just need to fill in the connection credentials for that FTP account.

Whether your files are owned by the web server user, or not, will depend on how you installed WordPress and how your server is configured. On some shared hosting platforms, it is a security risk for the files to be owned by the web server user and not a FTP user. See the tutorial on [Changing File Permissions](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/server/file-permissions/)<a> </a>for more information, including how to configure file permissions so that multiple FTP users are able to edit the files.

### Failed Updates

If you see a âfailed updateâ nag message, delete the file **.maintenance** from your WordPress directory using FTP. This will remove the âfailed updateâ nag message.

If the one-click upgrade doesnât work for you, donât panic! Just try a manual update.

## Manual Update

These are the short instructions, if you want more check out the [extended upgrade](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/upgrading/) instructions. If you experience problems with the Three Step Update, you may want to review the [more detailed upgrade instructions](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/upgrading/).

For these instructions, it is assumed that your blogâs URL is `http://example.com/wordpress/`.

### Step 1: Replace WordPress files

1. Get the [latest WordPress](#download) zip (or tar.gz) file.
2. Unpack the zip file that you downloaded.
3. Deactivate plugins.
4. Delete the old `wp-includes` and `wp-admin` directories on your web host (through your [FTP](#documentation/article/ftp-clients)<a> </a>or shell access).
5. Using [FTP ](#documentation/article/ftp-clients)or your shell access, upload the new `wp-includes` and `wp-admin` directories to your web host, in place of the previously deleted directories.
6. Upload the individual files from the new `wp-content` folder to your existing `wp-content` folder, overwriting existing files. Do NOT delete your existing `wp-content` folder. Do NOT delete any files or folders in your existing `wp-content` directory (except for the one being overwritten by new files).
7. Upload all new loose files from the root directory of the new version to your existing WordPress root directory.

NOTE â you should replace all the old WordPress files with the new ones in the `wp-includes` and `wp-admin` directories and sub-directories, and in the root directory (such as `index.php`, `wp-login.php` and so on). Donât worry â your `wp-config.php` will be safe.

Be careful when you come to copying the `wp-content` directory. You should make sure that you only copy the files from inside this directory, rather than replacing your entire `wp-content` directory. This is where your themes and plugins live, so you will want to keep them. If you have customized the default or classic themes without renaming them, make sure not to overwrite those files, otherwise you will lose your changes. (Though you might want to compare them for new features or fixes..)

Lastly you should take a look at the `wp-config-sample.php` file, to see if any new settings have been introduced that you might want to add to your own `wp-config.php`.

### Step 1.5: Remove .maintenance file

If youâre upgrading manually after a failed auto-upgrade, delete the file .maintenance from your WordPress directory using FTP. This will remove the âfailed updateâ nag message.

### Step 2: Update your installation

Visit your main WordPress admin page at /wp-admin. You may be asked to login again. If a database upgrade is necessary at this point, WordPress will detect it and give you a link to a URL like `http://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/upgrade.php`. Follow that link and follow the instructions. This will update your database to be compatible with the latest code. You should do this as soon as possible after step 1.

Donât forget to reactivate plugins!

### Step 3: Do something nice for yourself

If you have caching enabled, clear the cache at this point so the changes will go live immediately. Otherwise, visitors to your site (including you) will continue to see the old version (until the cache updates).

Your WordPress installation is successfully updated. Thatâs as simple as we can make it without [Updating WordPress Using Subversion](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion).

Consider rewarding yourself with a blog post about the update, reading that book or article youâve been putting off, or simply sitting back for a few moments and letting the world pass you by.

## Final Steps

Your update is now complete, so you can go in and enable your Plugins again.  
If you have issues with logging in, try clearing cookies in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

If anything has gone wrong, then the first thing to do is go through all the steps in our [extended upgrade instructions](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/upgrading/). That page also has information about some of the most common problems we see.

If you run into a request for FTP credentials with trying to update WP on a IIS server automatically, it may well be a matter of rights. Go into the IIS Management Console, and there to the application pool of your blog. In its advanced settings, change the Process Model Id into LocalSystem. Then on Sites, choose your blog, right click, click on Edit permissions and on security tab add authenticated users. That should do it.

If you experience problems after the upgrade, you can always [restore your backup](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/security/backup/)<a> </a>and replace the files with ones from your previous version from the [release archive](#downloadrelease-archive/).

### Other options

If you have some knowledge of unix shells you should check out [wp-cli](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/).

# WordPress Glossary <a name="documentation/article/wordpress-glossary" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-glossary/

This document is designed to offer definitions of various terms, exclusive to WordPress, that users may not be familiar with.

If you are a contributor, **please** donât add definitions for generic terms (API, PHP, JavaScript, etcâ¦).

## Absolute Path

*(also known as a **full path**)*

The complete location of a file or directory within a computer filesystem. An absolute path starts at the root directory (or drive letter) and continues up the directory hierarchy until the specific file or directory is reached. This contrasts with a [relative path](#relative-path), which does not start at the root directory.

The syntax of absolute paths differs by operating system. On Microsoft Windows, they begin with a drive letter and use a backslash to separate directory names. Absolute paths on macOS and Linux lack drive letters and use a forward slash as the directory separator.

Examples:

- Windows: `C:\Users\Matt\www\blog\images\icecream.jpg`
- macOS: `/Users/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg`
- Linux: `/home/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg`

To find the absolute filesystem path of the directory containing a web page, copy the code below into a new text file, save the file as *path.php* (thus making a simple PHP web page), and move that file to your [web server](#web-server). Then direct your web browser to the [URL](#url) address of that file (e.g. *<http://www.example.com/path.php>*).

```
<?php
echo getcwd();
?>
```

See also: [Path (computing) at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing))

## Absolute URI

*(also known as a **full URI**)*

A URI that contains the complete location of a resource (as opposed to a [relative URI](#relative-uri)).

Examples:

- `http://www.example.com/blog/images/icecream.jpg`
- `ftp://ftp.example.com/users/h/harriet/www/`

## Action

In WordPress; an Action is a [PHP function](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_functions.asp) that is executed at specific points throughout the WordPress Core.

Developers can create a **custom** Action using the [Action API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action) to add or remove code from an existing Action by specifying any [existing Hook](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference). This process is called â[hooking](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook)â.

**For example:** A developer may want to **add** code to the footer of a Theme. This could be accomplished by writing new function, then Hooking it to the [wp\_footer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/wp_footer) Action.

**Custom Actions differ from custom *[Filters](#filter)*** because custom Actions allow you to **add or remove** code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to **replace** specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.

- See also: [Filter](#filter), [Hook](#hook), [Terminology Confusion](#terminology-confusion)
- Related articles: [Actions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API#Actions), [Action Reference](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference), [add\_action()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action)
- Forum posts: [Filters vs. Actions Discussion and Explanation](#support/topic/fliters-vs-actions-from-a-newbe)

## Admin Bar

An area of the screen just above your site that gives you quick access to features such as adding a new post or editing your profile. It is only visible if you are logged in.

The admin bar concept was added to WordPress in [Version 3.1](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.1) and was replaced by the [Toolbar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Toolbar) in WordPress [Version 3.3](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3). To turn it on (or off), open the Dashboard and navigate to [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#your-profile) &gt; [Your Profile](/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/).

- Related articles: [Toolbar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Toolbar)
- See also: [Your Profile Screen](/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/)

## Ajax

**Ajax** is a technique that web pages use to have the server perform certain processing without reloading the web page. For example, when you approve a comment in a WordPress blog, WordPress uses Ajax to change the commentâs status, and you see the change without having to reload the Comments screen.

- Related article: [AJAX](https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX)
- External link: [AJAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax) (Wikipedia)

## Apache

**Apache** is short for **[Apache HTTP Server Project](http://httpd.apache.org/)**, a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available open source HTTP [Web server](#web-server) software produced by the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/). It is the most commonly used web server on the internet, and is available on many platforms, including Windows, [Unix](#unix)/[Linux](#linux), and [Mac OS X](#mac-os-x). Apache serves as a great foundation for publishing WordPress-powered sites.

## API

Please refer to [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) for a definition.

## Array

An **array** is one of the basic data structures used in computer programming. An *array* contains a list (or *vector*) of items such as numeric or string values. *Arrays* allow programmers to randomly access data. Data can be stored in either *one-dimensional* or *multi-dimensional arrays*.

A one-dimension array seven (7) elements would be:

| 105 | 200 | 54 | 53 | 102 | 13 | 405 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

The [Template Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) [wp\_list\_categories()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_categories) uses a one-dimensional array for the âexcludeâ parameter.

An example of two-dimensional array, 7 by 3 elements in size, would be:

| 105 | 200 | 54 | 53 | 102 | 13 | 405 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | 210 | 14 | 513 | 2 | 2313 | 4512 |
| 501 | 500 | 499 | 488 | 552 | 75 | 1952 |

- External links: [Array Programming at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming), [Array at freedictionary.com](http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/array)

## ASCII

**ASCII** (pronounced as âask eeâ) is a standard but limited [character set](#character-set) containing only English letters, numbers, a few common symbols, and common English punctuation marks. WordPress [content](#content) is not restricted to ASCII, but can include any [Unicode](#unicode) characters.

ASCII is short for **A**merican **S**tandard **C**ode for **I**nformation **I**nterchange.

- External links: [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (Wikipedia, with character set table)

## Atom

A format for syndicating content on news-like sites, viewable by Atom-aware programs called news readers or aggregators.

- See also: [News reader](#news-reader), [RSS](#rss), [RDF](#rdf)
- External links: [Atom (standard) at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard))

## Attribute sources

An object describing the attributes shape of a block. The keys can be named as most appropriate to describe the state of a block type. The value for each key is a function which describes the strategy by which the attribute value should be extracted from the content of a saved postâs content. When processed, a new object is created, taking the form of the keys defined in the attribute sources, where each value is the result of the attribute source function.

## Attributes

The object representation of the current state of a block in post content. When loading a saved post, this is determined by the attribute sources for the block type. These values can change over time during an editing session when the user modifies a block, and are used when determining how to serialize the block.

## Autosave

When you are writing or editing your posts and pages, the changes you make are automatically saved every 2 minutes. In the lower right corner of the editor, youâll see a notification of when the entry was last saved to the database. Autosaves are automatically enabled for all posts and pages. There is only one autosave for each post/page. Each new autosave overwrites the previous autosave in the database.

- Related articles: [Revision Management](https://codex.wordpress.org/Revision_Management)
- External links: [WordPress.com Support â Autosave](http://en.support.wordpress.com/autosave/)

## Avatar

An **avatar** is a graphic image or picture that represents a user.

- See also: [Gravatar](#gravatar)
- Related articles: [Using Gravatars](/support/article/how-to-use-gravatars/)
- External links: [Avatar (computing) at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%28computing%29)

## Back End

The back end is the area that authorized users can sign into to add, remove and modify content on the website. This may also be referred to as âWordPressâ, âadminâ or âthe administration areaâ.

## Binaries

**Binaries** refer to compiled computer programs, or executables. Many [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects, which can be re-compiled from [source code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code), offer pre-compiled binaries for the most popular platforms and operating systems.

## Block

The abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage. The idea combines concepts of what in WordPress today we achieve with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.

## Block (Inserter) Library

Primary interface for selecting from the [available blocks](#documentation/article/blocks), triggered by plus icon buttons on Blocks or in the top-left of the editor interface.

## Block categories

These are not a WordPress taxonomy, but instead used internally to sort blocks in the Block Library.

## Block name

A unique identifier for a block type, consisting of a plugin-specific namespace and a short label describing the blockâs intent. e.g. `core/image`

## Block styles

The CSS styles that are part of the block, either via its stylesheet or via the block markup itself. For example, a class attached to the block markup is considered block styles.

Compare to ***Global Styles***. In contraposition to Global Styles, block styles are sometimes referred to as [Local Styles](#documentation/article/glossary).

Learn more about [Block Styles](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/styles/#block-styles).

## Block supports

An API for blocks to declare what features they support. By declaring support for a feature, the API would add additional [attributes](#documentation/article/glossary) to the block and matching UI controls for most of the existing block supports.

See [Block Supports reference documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/) for a deep dive into the API.

## Block Template parts

Building on Block Templates, these parts help set structure for reusable items like a Footer or Header that one typically sees in a WordPress site. They are primarily site structure and are never to be mixed with the post content editor. With Full Site Editing and block based themes, users can create their own arbitrary Template Parts, save those in the database for their site, and re-use them throughout their site. Template parts are equivalent â in blocks â of theme template parts. They are generally defined by a theme first, carry some semantic meaning (could be swapped between themes such as a header), and can only be inserted in the site editor context (within âtemplatesâ).

## Block Templates

A template is a predefined arrangement of blocks, possibly with predefined attributes or placeholder content. You can provide a template for a post type, to give users a starting point when creating a new piece of content, or inside a custom block with the `<strong>InnerBlocks</strong>` component. At their core, templates are simply HTML files of block markup that map to templates from the standard WordPress template hierarchy, for example index, single or archive. This helps control the front-end defaults of a site that are not edited via the Page Editor or the Post Editor. See the [templates documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-templates/) for more information.

## Block Themes

A theme built in block forward way that allows Full Site Editing to work. The core of a block theme are its block templates and block template parts. To date, block theme templates have been HTML files of block markup that map to templates from the standard WordPress template hierarchy.

## Block type

In contrast with the blocks composing a particular post, a block type describes the blueprint by which any block of that type should behave. So while there may be many images within a post, each behaves consistent with a unified image block type definition.

## Blog

A **blog**, or **weblog**, is an online journal, diary, or serial published by a person or group of people.

Blogs are commonly used by individuals, peer groups, companies, or organizations.

Blogs often contain public as well as private content. Depending on the functionality of the [CMS](#content-management-system) software that is used, some authors may restrict access â through the use of accounts or passwords â to content that is too personal to be published publicly.

## Blogging

**Blogging** is the act of writing in oneâs blog. To *blog* something is to write about something in oneâs blog. This sometimes involves [linking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) to something the author finds interesting on the internet.

- See also: [Blogosphere](#blogosphere), [Blogroll](#blogroll)

## Blogosphere

The **blogosphere** is the subset of internet web sites which are, or relate to, [blogs](#blog).

- See also: [Blog](#blog), [Blogroll](#blogroll)

## Blogroll

A **blogroll** is a list of links to various blogs or news sites. Often a blogroll is ârolledâ by a service which tracks updates (using [feeds](#feed)) to each site in the list, and provides the list in a form which aggregates update information. The default blogroll (aka links) included in WordPress was removed in version 3.5.

- See also: [Blog](#blog), [Blogosphere](#blogosphere), [Feed](#feed), [News reader](#news-reader)
- External links: [News aggregator at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator)

## Bookmarklet

A **bookmarklet** (or **favelet**) is a âfauxâ bookmark containing scripting code, usually written in [JavaScript](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#javascript), that allows the user to perform a function.

Examples:

- The [delicious.com bookmarklets](http://delicious.com/help/bookmarklets) allow users to quickly post a link to their delicious.com bookmarks list.
- [Tantekâs favelets](http://tantek.com/favelets/)

## Boolean

A variable or expression which evaluates to either true or false.

- External links: [PHP Boolean data type](http://us2.php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.php)

## Category

Each [post](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post) in WordPress can be filed under one or more **categories**. Thoughtful categorization allows posts to be grouped with others of similar content and aids in the navigation of a site.

Please note that a **post** category should not be confused with a [**link** category](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Link_Categories), which is used to classify and manage [links](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Links_-_Putting_the_Inter_in_the_Internet).

## Capabilities

A **capability** is permission to perform one or more types of task. Each user of a WordPress site might have some permissions but not others, depending on their [role](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Role). For example, users who have the Author role usually have permission to edit their own posts (the âedit\_postsâ capability), but not permission to edit other usersâ posts (the âedit\_others\_postsâ capability). WordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities in its role-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.

- Related article: [Roles and Capabilities](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities)
- External link: [Role-based access control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) (Wikipedia)

## CGI

**CGI** (Common Gateway Interface) is a specification for [server-side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side) communication scripts designed to transfer information between a [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) and a [web-client (browser)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side). Typically, [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) pages that collect data via forms use *CGI* programming to process the form data once the client submits it.

## Character Entity

A **character entity** is a method used to display *special characters* normally *reserved* for use in [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML). For example, the *less than* (**&lt;**) and *greater than* (**&gt;**) are used as part the [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) tag structure, so both symbols are *reserved* for that use. But, if you need to display those symbols on your site, you can use *character entities*. For example: use **`&lt;`** for the less than (&lt;) symbol use **`&gt;`** for the greater than (&gt;) symbol

- Related articles: [Fun Character Entities](https://codex.wordpress.org/Fun_Character_Entities)

## Character Set

A **character set** is a collection of symbols (letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters), when used together, represent meaningful words in a language. Computers use an encoding scheme so members of a character set are stored with a numeric value (e.g. 0=A, 1=B, 2=C, 3=D). In addition, a [collation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Collation) determines the order (i.e alphabetic) to use when sorting the character set.

By default, WordPress uses the Unicode UTF-8 (**utf8**) character set for the [WordPress MySQL database tables](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description) created during the [installation process](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). Beginning with [Version 2.2](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.2), the database character set (and collation) is defined in the *wp-config.php* file.

## chmod

**chmod** is a [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix)/[Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux) [shell](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Shell) command used to change [permissions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Permissions) on files. Its name is a contraction of â**ch**ange **mod**e.â

## Class

**Classes** are groupings of [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CSS) styles which can be applied to any [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) element. For classes in PHP, see the [Class (Computing)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class#Computing) article at Wikipedia and [PHP Manual: Classes and Objects](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php).

- Related articles: [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/CSS), [Blog Design and Layout](https://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout)

## Classic block

A block which embeds the TinyMCE editor as a block, TinyMCE was the base of the previous core editor. Older content created prior to the block editor will be loaded in to a single Classic block.

## Codex

The **Codex** is the series of articles that show users how to use WordPress. WordPress users contribute documentation to the codex voluntarily.

- External links: [Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page)

## Collation

**Collation** refers to the order used to sort the letters, numbers, and symbols of a given [character set](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Character_set). For example, because WordPress, by default, uses the UTF-8 (**utf8**) character set, and when the [WordPress MySQL database tables](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description) are created during the [installation process](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress), MySQL assigns **utf8\_general\_ci** collation to those tables. Beginning with [Version 2.2](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.2), the collation (and character set) used by WordPress is defined in the *wp-config.php* file.

## Comments

**Comments** are a feature of [blogs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog) which allow readers to respond to [posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post). Typically readers simply provide their own thoughts regarding the [content](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content) of the post, but users may also provide [links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) to other resources, generate discussion, or simply compliment the author for a well-written post.

You can control and regulate comments by filters for language and content. Comments can be queued for approval before they are visible on the web site. This is useful in dealing with [comment spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam).

- External links: [Hyperlink at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)

## Content

**Content** consists of text, images, or other information shared in [posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post). This is separate from the structural design of a web site, which provides a framework into which the content is inserted, and the presentation of a site, which involves graphic design. A [Content Management System](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content_Management_System) changes and updates content, rather than the structural or graphic design of a web site.

## Content Management System

A **Content Management System**, or **CMS**, is software for facilitating the maintenance of [content](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content), but not design, on a web site. A [blogging](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog) tool is an example of a Content Management System.

- See also: [Blog](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog)

## cPanel

**cPanel** is a popular web-based administration tool that many [hosting providers](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hosting_provider) provide to allow users to configure their own accounts using an easy-to-use interface.

- External links: [cPanel website](http://cpanel.net/)

## CSS

**CSS**, or **Cascading Style Sheets**, is a [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) [open standards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) programming language for specifying how a web page is presented. It allows web site designers to create formatting and layout for a web site independently of its content.

- External links: [CSS at W3C](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), [Open standards at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard), [W3C.org](http://www.w3.org/)

## CVS

**CVS** stands for **Concurrent Versions System** and is the software that used to be used to coordinate WordPress development. As of February 2005, this function is carried out by Subversion ([SVN](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#SVN)).

For more information on Subversion, see [Using Subversion](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Subversion).

## Dashboard

In WordPress a **Dashboard** is the main administration screen for a site (a weblog), or for a network of sites. It summarizes information about the site or network, and also external information, in one or more [widgets](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Widget) that the Dashboard user can enable, disable, and move around.

- Related articles: [Dashboard Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Dashboard_Screen)

## Database

A **database** in computing terms is software used to manage information in an organized fashion. [WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#WordPress) uses the [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB) relational databases management system for storing and retrieving the content of your [blog](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog), such as [posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Posts), [comments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Comments), and so on.

- Related articles: [Database Description](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description), [Backing Up Your Database](https://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database)

## Database version

In WordPress, the **database version** is a number that increases every time changes are made to the way WordPress organizes the data in its [database](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#database). It is not the same as the version of the database software, [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB).

For example, the database version in WordPress 3.3 was 19470, and the database version in WordPress 3.3.1 did not change. This tells anyone planning to use backed-up data from the older version that they do not need to check for changes in the structure of the data.

WordPress stores its database version in the database, as the option named âdb\_versionâ in every WordPress siteâs âwp\_optionsâ table. (The table name prefix âwp\_â may be missing or different in some cases.)

- Related articles: [Database Description](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description), [How do you force a database upgrade?](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Installation#How_do_you_force_a_database_upgrade.3F)

## Default theme

Every installation of WordPress has a default theme. The default theme is sometimes called the **fallback theme**, because if the active theme is for some reason lost or deleted, WordPress will fallback to using the default theme.

## Deprecated

**Deprecated** functions or template tags are no longer supported, and will soon be obsolete.

- Related articles: [âDeprecated Functionsâ Category](https://codex.wordpress.org/Category:Deprecated_Functions)

## Developer

A **developer**, or **dev**, is a computer programmer who is active in creating, modifying, and updating a software product.

- Related articles: [Plugin API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API)

## DIV

A **DIV** element in [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) marks a section of text. DIVs are used extensively in WordPress to apply [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CSS) stylings to particular [blog](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog) elements.

- Related articles: [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/CSS), [Blog Design and Layout](https://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout)

## DNS

**DNS**, the domain name system, is the system that maps [domain names](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Domain_name) to [IP addresses](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address). When you use a web browser to visit a website, your browser first extracts the siteâs domain name from the URL. Then it uses the DNS to find the IP address for that domain name. Then it connects to that IP address.

- External link: [Domain Name System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (Wikipedia)

## DOM

**DOM** (Document Object Model) is a standard, platform-independent interface that allows programmers to dynamically access HTML and XML to control the content and structure of documents. DOM connects programming scripts to web pages.

- External links: [DOM at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model), [DOM at W3C.org](http://www.w3.org/DOM/)

## Domain name

A **domain name** is a name used for identification purposes on the Internet. In WordPress a domain name usually identifies a server where WordPress is installed. To make this work, the Internetâs domain name system ([DNS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#DNS)) maps the domain name to a serverâs [IP address](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address). For example, the domain name *example.com* maps to the IP address *192.0.43.10*. Many domain names can map to the same IP address, allowing a single server to run many websites. For example, the domain names *www.example.com* and *example.net* also map to the IP address *192.0.43.10*.

- External link: [Domain name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) (Wikipedia)

## Draft

The **draft** [post status](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post_status) is for WordPress [posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post) which are saved, but as yet unpublished. A draft post can only be edited through the [Administration Panel](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels), [Write Post SubPanel](https://codex.wordpress.org/Write_Post_SubPanel) by [users](https://codex.wordpress.org/Authors_and_Users_SubPanel#Table_of_Authors) of equal or greater [User Level](https://codex.wordpress.org/User_Levels) than the [postâs author](https://codex.wordpress.org/Authors_and_Users_SubPanel#Table_of_Registered_Users).

## Dynamic block

A type of block where the content of which may change and cannot be determined at the time of saving a post, instead calculated any time the post is shown on the front of a site. These blocks may save fallback content or no content at all in their JavaScript implementation, instead deferring to a PHP block implementation for runtime rendering.

## Excerpt

An **excerpt** is a condensed description of your blog [post](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post) and refers to the summary entered in the Excerpt field of the [Administration](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels) &gt; [Posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels#Add_New_Post) &gt; [Add New SubPanel](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Add_New_SubPanel). The *excerpt* is used to describe your post in RSS feeds and is typically used in displaying search results. The *excerpt* is sometimes used in displaying the **Archives** and [Category](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category) views of your posts. Use the [Template Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) [the\_excerpt()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_excerpt) to display the contents of this field. Note that if you do not enter information into the Excerpt field when writing a post, and you use [the\_excerpt()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_excerpt) in your theme template files, WordPress will automatically display the first 55 words of the [post](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post)âs content.

An *excerpt* should not be confused with the **teaser**, which refers to words before the `\<!--more-->` in a [postâs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post) content. When typing a long post you can insert the `<!--more-->` [Quicktag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Add_New_SubPanel#Visual_Versus_HTML_Editor) after a few sentences to act as a cut-off point. When the post is displayed, the **teaser**, followed by a hyperlink (such as **Read the rest of this entryâ¦**), is displayed. Your visitor can then click on that link to see the full version of your [post](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post). The [Template Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags), [the\_content()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_content) should be used to display the teaser.

## Feed

A **feed** is a function of special software that allows âFeedreadersâ to access a site automatically looking for new content and then posting the information about new content and updates to another site. This provides a way for users to keep up with the latest and hottest information posted on different blogging sites. Some Feeds include RSS (alternately defined as âRich Site Summaryâ or âReally Simple Syndicationâ), Atom or RDF files. Dave Shea, author of the web design weblog [Mezzoblue](http://mezzoblue.com) has written [a comprehensive summary](http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/05/19/what_is_rssx/) of feeds. Feeds generally are based on [XML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#XML) technology.

## Feed Reader

The role of Feedreader is to gather and display the webfeed from various website to one place.

## Filter

In WordPress, a Filter is a [function](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_functions.asp) that is associated with an existing [Action](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action) by specifying any [existing Hook](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference).

Developers can create [**custom** Filters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter) using the [Filter API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference) to **replace** code from an existing Action. This process is called â[hooking](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook)â.

**Custom Filters differ from custom *[Actions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action)*** because custom Actions allow you to **add or remove** code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to **replace** specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.

## Footer area

A **footer area** is a horizontal area provided by a [theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Theme) for displaying information other than the main [content](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content) of the web page. Themes may provide one or more footer areas below the content. Footer areas usually contain [widgets](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Widget) that an administrator of the site can customize.

In a theme, footer areas are generated by a [template](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Template) file, typically named *sidebar-footer.php*.

## Front End

The front end is what your visitors see and interact with when they come to your website, www.YourSite.com.

## FTP

**FTP**, or **File Transfer Protocol**, is a client-server protocol for transferring files. It is one way to download files, and the most common way to upload files to a server.

An FTP *client* is a program which can download files from, or upload files to, an FTP *server*.

You may need to use an FTP client to upload your WordPress files to your [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server), particularly if you use a [hosting provider](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hosting_provider).

## Full Site Editing or FSE

This refers to a collection of features that ultimately allows users to edit their entire website using blocks as the starting point. This feature set includes everything from block patterns to global styles to templates to design tools for blocks (and more). First released in WordPress 5.9.

## Gallery

As defined by Andy Skelton, **Gallery**, introduced with [WordPress 2.5](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.5), is specifically an exposition of images attached to a post. In that same vein, an upload is âattached to a postâ when you upload it while editing a post.

In the uploader there is a âGalleryâ tab that shows all the uploads attached to the post you are editing. When you have more than one attachment in a post, you should see at the bottom of the Gallery tab a button marked âInsert galleryâ. That button inserts a shortcode ââ into the post. WordPress replaces that shortcode with an exposition of all images attached to that post. Non-image file types are excluded from the gallery.

Note: If you donât see the âInsert galleryâ button, it may be because you have not attached two images to the post.

The pretty URLs for attachments are made only after you have published the post and should be composed as the post [permalink](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#permalink) plus the attachment [slug](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#slug).

## gettext

The **gettext** system is a set of tools and standards for language translation, used by WordPress to provide versions in many languages. In WordPress a text string for translation may have a domain and a context. For example, a plugin might specify its own domain for translations, and a context might help translators to provide different translations of the same English word or phrase in different parts of the user interface.

## GMT

**GMT** (âGreenwich Mean Timeâ, the time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England) is the old name of the time zone from which all other time zones were measured. It has been replaced by [UTC](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#UTC) (âUniversal Time, Coordinatedâ), but for most practical purposes UTC and GMT are the same, so the term GMT is still commonly used.

- External links: [Greenwich Mean Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time), [Time zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone), [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (Wikipedia)

## Gravatar

A **gravatar** is a globally recognized [avatar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Avatar) (a graphic image or picture that represents a user). Typically a userâs gravatar is associated with their email address, and using a service such as [Gravatar.com](http://en.gravatar.com/). The site owner to can configure their site so that a userâs gravatar is displayed along with their comments.

## GUI

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface, pronounced as âgooeyâ. It is an interface that allows users to point the mouse or cursor to graphical icons.

## Gutenberg

Gutenberg is newly developed, block-oriented editor. It uses blocks to create all types of content, replacing a half-dozen inconsistent ways of customizing WordPress, bringing it in line with modern coding standards, and aligning with open web initiatives. These content blocks transform how users, developers, and hosts interact with WordPress to make building rich web content easier and more intuitive, democratizing publishing â and work â for everyone, regardless of technical ability.

## Hack

A **hack** is a bit of code written to customize or extend the functionality of a software product. Older versions of WordPress used a hack-based extension system, but versions [1.2](https://codex.wordpress.org/Changelog/1.2) and above of WordPress use a [Plugin API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API) with [hooks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook) for extensions.

## Hacking

**Hacking** is the process of writing code for, or contributing code to, a piece of software.

There is some controversy surrounding the meaning of this term. It began as a benign term meaning âto exercise proficiencyâ or âto alter or improve,â but the popular media have since construed it to mean âto break into a computer system, usually with malicious intent.â Many in the computer industry have recently begun trying to âtake backâ the word from its popular mutation, and many have adopted the term *cracking* to replace the malicious interpretation. Because of the desire to reclaim the word, you will often find the term used in conjunction with [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects, intended in its benign form. For more information about the history of the term, please see [Wikipediaâs article on *Hacker*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker).

## Header Image

A **Header Image** is a wide picture that appears at the top of a WordPress website.

## Hook

Hooks are specified, by the developer, in Actions and Filters. Here is a (hopefully) complete list of all [existing Hooks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference) within WordPress.

Because Hooks are required by Actions and Filter you may hear the phrase âAction Hooksâ and âFilter Hooksâ used from time to time.

In technical and strict terms: a Hook is an event, i.e. event as understood by [Observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern), invoked by the [do\_action()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_action) or [apply\_filters()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/apply_filters) call that afterwards triggers all the [action](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action) or [filter](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Filter) functions, previously hooked to that event using [add\_action()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action) or [add\_filter()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_filter), respectively.

### Terminology Confusion

WordPress Codex and source code comments sometimes confuse the terms â[actions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Action)/[filters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Filter)â and â[hooks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hook)â.

Actions, Filters and Hooks are also occasionally referred to as âaction/filter hooksâ or âaction/filter/hook functionsâ.

## Hosting provider

A **hosting provider** is a company or organization which provides, usually for a fee, infrastructure for making information accessible via the web. This involves the use of a [web server](#documentation/article/glossary) (including web server software such as [Apache](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Apache)), and may involve one or more related technologies, such as [FTP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#FTP), [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP), [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB), and operating system software such as [Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux) or [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix).

- Related articles: [Hosting WordPress](#about/requirements)

## .htaccess

A **.htaccess** file is a granular configuration file for the [Apache](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Apache) [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) software, used to set or alter the serverâs configuration settings for the directory in which it is present, and/or its child directories.

WordPress uses an *.htaccess* file in conjunction with the [mod\_rewrite](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#mod_rewrite) [Apache](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Apache) module to produce [permalinks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Permalink).

Note that *.htaccess* is a *hidden file* in [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix)/[Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux) (as dictated by the preceding period â.â), meaning it may not be visible using the default settings of some [FTP clients](https://codex.wordpress.org/FTP_Clients).

- See also: [chmod](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#chmod)

## HTML

**HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**, is a markup language used to describe the semantic content of web pages. It is usually used with [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CSS) and/or [JavaScript](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#JavaScript). WordPress renders web pages to conform to the HTML5 standard. The standard is set by the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)).

## IDE

Acronym for Integrated Development Environment. Is an application that provides several tools for software development. An **IDE** usually includes:

- source code editor, which is similar to a [Text Editor](#documentation/article/glossary)
- debugger, in the case of WordPress, useful debuggers are those for [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP) and [Javascript](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Javascript) code
- automated builder

For our recommended IDEs, please see [Editing Files](#documentation/article/editing-files).

## Inspector

Deprecated term. See [Settings Sidebar](#documentation/article/glossary).

## IP address

An **IP address** is a unique number (e.g. *70.84.29.148*) assigned to a computer (or other internet-capable information appliance, such as a network printer) to enable it to communicate with other devices using the *Internet Protocol*. It is a computerâs identity on the internet, and every computer connected to the internet is assigned at least one â although the methods of assigning these addresses, and the permanence and duration of their assignment, differ according to the use of the computer and the circumstances of its internet use.

Every [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) is assigned an IP address as well, but often times [hosting providers](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hosting_provider) will assign multiple IP addresses to one computer, in the event that multiple web sites reside on the same physical server. This is the case with most inexpensive âmanagedâ or âgroupâ hosting packages.

[Domain names](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Domain_name) were created to provide an easier means of accessing internet resources than IP addresses, which are cumbersome to type and difficult to remember. Every domain name has at least one corresponding IP address, but only a small number of IP addresses have a domain name associated with them, since only computers that are servers require domain names. The domain name system ([DNS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#DNS)) is what maps domain names to IP addresses.

- External links: [IP address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) (Wikipedia)

## ISAPI

**ISAPI** (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) is a set of programming standards designed to allow programmers to quickly and easily develop efficient Web-based applications. Developed by Process Software and Microsoft Corporation, *ISAPI* is intended to replace [CGI](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CGI) programs.

- External links: [ISAPI at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAPI)

## JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a programming language that WordPress uses to make certain processing occur in your web browser when it is inconvenient or impossible for the server to do that processing. For example, when you reply to a comment in a WordPress blog, WordPress uses JavaScript to move the comment form inside the comment you are replying to.

## Linux

**Linux** is an [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) computer operating system, created by Linus Torvalds, similar in style to [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix). It is popular in [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) and other high-performance computing environments, and has recently begun to gain popularity in workstation environments as well.

- External links: [Linux at Shortopedia](http://www.shortopedia.com/L/I/Linux)

## Local Styles

See [Block Styles](#documentation/article/glossary).

## Mac OS X

**[Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)** is an operating system specifically for modern Macintosh computers. The operating system was commercially released in 2001. It consists of two main parts: Darwin, an open source [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix)-like environment which is based on the BSD source tree and the Mach microkernel, adapted and further developed by Apple Computer with involvement from independent developers; and a proprietary GUI named Aqua, developed by Apple.

## MariaDB

MariaDB is a fork of the [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) relational database system developed by most of the original developers of MySQL. It works equally well with WordPress.

## Menu

**Menus** are lists of links to pages and posts that appear on WordPress websites.

## Meta

**Meta** has several meanings, but generally means **information about**. In WordPress, *meta* usually refers to **administrative** type information. As described in [Meta Tags in WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Meta_Tags_in_WordPress), *meta* is the [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) tag used to describe and define a web page to the outside world (search engines). In the article [Post Meta Data](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Meta_Data_Section), *meta* refers to information associated with each **post**, such as the authorâs name and the date posted. [Meta Rules](https://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Meta_Rules) define the general protocol to follow in using the Codex. Also, many WordPress based sites offer a *Meta* section, usually found in the sidebar, with links to login or register at that site. Finally, *Meta* is a [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) [namespace](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Namespace) that refers to administrative functions within Codex.

- External links: [Wikipediaâs Article on Meta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-)

## Microformats

**Microformats** provide a way for programs to read certain information in web pages without making the pages look any different to humans. They add semantics to the generic HTML markup in order for these programs to understand the meaning of specific parts of a web page content which is better recognized by humans. For example, a web page displaying a userâs profile could use microformats to make it easy for a program to extract the userâs contact information so that it can be added to an address book in a single operation. In WordPress, some [themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#theme) and [plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#plugin) support some microformats.

- Related: [Themes](#extend/themes/tags/microformats) and [plugins](#extend/plugins/tags/microformats) providing microformats support
- External links: [Microformats.org](http://microformats.org/)

## MIME

**MIME** stands for **Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension** and is an Internet standard that extends the format of email to support:

- Text in character sets other than ASCII
- Non-text attachments
- Message bodies with multiple parts
- Header information in non-ASCII character sets

MIMEâs use, however, has grown beyond describing the content of email and now is often used to describe content type in general including for the web and as a storage for rich content in some commercial products.

- External links: [IANA Media Types Specification](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME)

## Moblogging

**Moblogging** is the act of posting to oneâs [blog](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog) via a mobile device (e.g. mobile phone, smartphone, or tablet). It is pronounced as *mÅbÉ-logging* or *mÅb-logging*, or sometimes as *mÅb-logging* in reference to *smart mobs*.

- Related articles: [Moblog Clients](https://codex.wordpress.org/Weblog_Client#Mobile), [Post to your blog using email](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_to_your_blog_using_email)

## mod\_rewrite

**mod\_rewrite** is an extension module of the [Apache](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Apache) [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) software which allows for ârewritingâ of [URLs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url) on-the-fly. Rewrite *rules* use [regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to parse the requested URL from the client, translate it into a different URL, and serve the content of this new URL under the original URL or pointing the client to make the new URL request.

WordPress uses *mod\_rewrite* for its [permalink](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Permalink) structure, and also for [multisite](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite) networks, which are both optional functionality.

- Related articles: [Using Permalinks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks), [Create A Network](https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network)

## Multisite

**Multisite** is a feature of [WordPress 3.0](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0) and later versions that allows multiple virtual [sites](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Site) to share a single WordPress installation. When the multisite feature is activated, the original WordPress site can be converted to support a [network](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Network) of sites.

- Related article: [Create A Network](#documentation/article/create-a-network)

## MySQL

**MySQL** is a popular [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) SQL (Structured Query Language) database implementation, available for many platforms, including Windows, [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix)/[Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux) and [Mac OS X](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Mac_OS_X).

WordPress requires a MySQL database to store all [blog](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog) information, including [posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post), [comments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Comments), [metadata](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Meta), and other information.

WordPress also works with MySQL-compatible databases such as [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB) and Percona Server.

[Back to the Top](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#top)

## Navigation

Navigation is the term used to describe text on a page that, when selected, redirects you to a corresponding page elsewhere on the website. Navigation may sometimes be referred to as the menu, links and hyperlinks.

## Navigation Block

A block that allows you to edit a siteâs navigation menu, both in terms of structure and design.

## Network

In the WordPress user interface, a **network** is a collection of separate [sites](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Site) created in a single WordPress installation by the [multisite](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite) feature. The sites in a WordPress network are not interconnected like the things in other kinds of networks. They are very like the separate blogs at WordPress.com.

In WordPress code the network is known as the *site* and the sites are known as *blogs*.

- Related articles: [Create A Network](https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network)

## News reader

A **news aggregator** or **news (feed) reader** is a computer program which tracks syndicated information [feeds](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Feed), via [RSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RSS), [RDF](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RDF), or [Atom](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Atom). Most news aggregators allow one to âsubscribeâ to a feed, and automatically keep track of the articles one has read, similar to an email client tracking read emails.

Many [blogs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Blog) make their content available in [feed](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Feed) form for the convenience of readers using news aggregators. WordPress can generate feeds in [RSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RSS) and/or [Atom](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Atom) formats.

- External links: [News aggregator at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator)

## Nonce

**Nonce** is used for security purposes to protect against unexpected or duplicate requests that could cause undesired permanent or irreversible changes to the web site and particularly to its database. Specifically, a nonce is an one-time token generated by a [web site](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_site) to identify future requests to that web site. When a request is submitted, the web site verifies if a previously generated nonce expected for this particular kind of request was sent along and decides whether the request can be safely processed, or a notice of failure should be returned. This could prevent unwanted repeated, expired or malicious requests from being processed.

Nonce is usually included in a hidden HTML form field or as a part of an URL and therefore sent with a request by submitting a form field or visiting a link. If a request is not verified, the web site could generate a new nonce in its response and prompt the user to intentionally confirm the repetition of the request. In WordPress, the response message is *âAre you sure you want to do this?â* by default.

- Related articles: [WordPress Nonces](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces)

## Open Source

**Open source** is simply programming code that can be read, viewed, modified, and distributed, by anyone who desires. WordPress is distributed under an *open source* [GNU General Public License (GPL)](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

- Related articles: [GPL](https://codex.wordpress.org/GPL), [License](https://codex.wordpress.org/License)
- External links: [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/), [Open Source at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), [Source Code at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)

## Options

**Options** are pieces of data that WordPress uses to store various preferences and configuration settings. By using the [Options API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API) that is a simple and standardized way of storing data in the database, options can be [added](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_option), [changed](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_option), [removed](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/delete_option), and [retrieved](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_option), from the [wp\_options table](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Table:_wp_options).

- Related articles: [Option Reference](https://codex.wordpress.org/Option_Reference), [Transients API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API), [Options API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API)

## Output Compression

**Output Compression** is the removal of white spaces, carriage returns, new lines and tabs from your HTML document. This reduces the file size of the HTML document without changing the functionality.

- Related articles: [Output Compression](https://codex.wordpress.org/Output_Compression)

## Page (post type)

A **Page** is often used to present âstaticâ information about yourself or your site. A good example of a Page is information you would place on an About Page. A Page should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called [posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Post). Pages are typically âtimelessâ in nature and live âoutsideâ your blog.

The word âpageâ has long been used to describe any HTML document on the web. In WordPress, however, âPageâ refers to a very specific feature first introduced in WordPress version 1.5.

- Related articles: [Pages](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages), [Write Page SubPanel](https://codex.wordpress.org/Write_Page_SubPanel)

## Patterns

WordPress 6.3 renamed Reusable Blocks to Patterns. A synced pattern will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block.

Patterns are layouts of blocks that can be inserted as starter content that are meant to be changed by the user every time. Once inserted, they exist as a local save and are not global.

 Related articles: [Patterns](#documentation/article/block-pattern), [Comparing Patterns to Template Parts](#documentation/article/comparing-patterns-template-parts-and-reusable-blocks).

## Perl

**Perl** is an acronym for **Practical Extraction and Report Language**, but itâs most commonly spelled as a proper name. Itâs a very popular and powerful scripting language used for web applications, although its use is being largely replaced by [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP) in the mainstream. One of its strengths lies in its speedy and effective use of [regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). Its unofficial motto is, âThereâs More Than One Way To Do It,â or âTMTOWTDI,â owing to the extreme flexibility of the syntax.

WordPress does not use Perl, and it is therefore not required.

## Permalink

A **permalink** is a [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url) at which a resource or article will be permanently stored. Many pages driven by [Content Management Systems](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content_Management_System) contain excerpts of content which is frequently rotated, making linking to bits of information within them a game of chance. Permalinks allow users to bookmark full articles at a [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url) they know will never change, and will always present the same content.

Permalinks are optional in WordPress, but are highly recommended as they greatly increase the cleanliness of [URL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url). WordPress uses the [Apache](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Apache) module *[mod\_rewrite](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#mod_rewrite)* to implement its permalink system.

- Related articles: [Using Permalinks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks)
- External links: [URL at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url)

## Permissions

**Permissions** are security settings restricting or allowing users to perform certain functions. In the case of files on [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix) or [Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux) systems, there are three types of permissions: *read*, *write*, and *execute*. In the case of [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB) databases, there are many more: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc. â although MySQL/MariaDB refer to them as *privileges*.

- Related articles: [Changing File Permissions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions)

## PHP

**PHP** is a recursive acronym for **PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor**. It is a popular server-side scripting language designed specifically for integration with [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML), and is used (often in conjunction with [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB)) in [Content Management Systems](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content_Management_System) and other web applications. It is available on many platforms, including Windows, [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix)/[Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux) and [Mac OS X](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Mac_OS_X), and is [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software.

WordPress is written using PHP and requires it for operation.

- External links: [PHP Website](http://php.net/), [PHP for Designers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402040826/http://www.digital-web.com/articles/php_for_designers/) â by WordPress lead [developer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Developer) [Matthew Mullenweg](https://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt), [PHP at OnLAMP](http://www.onlamp.com/php/)

## phpMyAdmin

**phpMyAdmin** is a popular, powerful web-based interface for administering [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB) databases. It is [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), written in [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP), and is among the better tools available for working with [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) or [MariaDB](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MariaDB) databases.

## Ping

Within the WordPress interface, âpingâ is sometimes used to refer to [Pingbacks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Pingback) and [Trackbacks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Trackback).

In general computer terms, âpingâ is a common utility used in a TCP/IP environment to determine if a given [IP Address](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address) exists or is reachable. Typically, Ping is used to diagnose a network connection problem. Many times you will be asked, âCan you ping that address?â. That means, does the Ping utility return a success message trying to reach the âproblemâ [IP Address](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address)?

- External links: [Ping at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping)

## Pingback

**Pingback** lets you notify the author of an article if you link to his article (article on a blog, of course). If the links you include in an article you write on a blog lead to a blog which is pingback-enabled, then the author of that blog gets a notification in the form of a pingback that you linked to his article.

If youâre feeling *really* geeky you may want to check out the [Pingback technical specification](http://hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) or [Ottoâs âHow Pingbacks Workâ explanation](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2009-September/027425.html).

- Related articles: [Introduction to Blogging: Pingbacks](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging)

## Plugin

A **Plugin** is a group of PHP functions that can extend the functionality present in a standard WordPress weblog. These functions may all be defined in one php file, or may be spread among more than one file. Usually, a plugin is a PHP file that can be uploaded to the âwp-content/pluginsâ directory on your webserver, where you have installed WordPress. Once you have uploaded the plugin file, you should be able to âturn it onâ or Enable it from the âPluginsâ page in the administration interface of your weblog. The WordPress source code contains hooks that can be used by plugins.

- Related articles: [Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins)

## Port

Within the context of the WordPress community, a **port** is a bit of code that has been rewritten to be compatible with WordPress. For example, if someone wrote a plugin for MoveableType, WordPress users may want to find a port of that plugin for WordPress. Port can also be used as a verb: to rewrite a piece of software for a different platform/language.

- External links: [Porting at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting)

## Post

Also known as âarticlesâ and sometimes incorrectly referred to as âblogsâ. In WordPress, âpostsâ are articles that you write to populate your blog.

## Post settings

A sidebar region containing metadata fields for the post, including scheduling, visibility, terms, and featured image.

## Post Slug

A few lowercase words separated by dashes, describing a post and usually derived from the post title to create a user-friendly (that is, readable and without confusing characters) [permalink](https://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks). Post slug substitutes the â%posttitle%â placeholder in a [custom permalink structure](https://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks#Choosing_your_permalink_structure). Post slug should not be changed and is especially useful if the post title tends to be long or changes frequently.

## Post Status

The status of a post, as set in the [Administration Panel](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels), [Write Post SubPanel](https://codex.wordpress.org/Write_Post_SubPanel) is either: **Published** (viewable by everyone), **Draft** (incomplete post viewable by anyone with proper [user level](https://codex.wordpress.org/User_Levels)), or **Private** (viewable only to WordPress users at Administrator level).

- Related articles: [Post Status](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Status)

## Post Type

Post type refers to the various structured data that is maintained in the WordPress posts table. Native (or built-in) registered post types are **post**, **page**, **attachment**, **revision**, and **nav-menu-item**. Custom post types are also supported in WordPress and can be defined with [register\_post\_type()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type). Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things as portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and whatever a user or developer can imagine.

## Query Block

A block that replicates the classic [WP\_Query](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/) and allows for further customization with additional functionality.

## Query String

A sequence of codes in a [Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) that a web page uses to determine what dynamic data to display. The query string in a [URI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) comes after an initial question mark, and may contain several parameters separated by ampersands. WordPress uses query strings to indicate criteria to search for specific posts or sets of posts in the database. The use of query strings is generally believed to impede the indexing of dynamic pages by search engines. For this reason, it is often desirable to use a method such as [mod\_rewrite](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#mod_rewrite) to reduce exposure of query strings to search engines and other site visitors.

## Query Variable

A variable passed through the [query string](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Query_string). For example, in the query string *?category\_name=tech&amp;feed=atom*, there are two query variables: *category\_name* with a value of âtechâ, and *feed* with a value of âatomâ.

## QuickTag

A **Quicktag** is a shortcut, or one-click button, that inserts HTML code into your posts. The &lt;em&gt; (emphasis) and &lt;/em&gt; (stop emphasis) HTML tags are example of Quicktags. Some Quicktags, such as &lt;!âcontactformâ&gt;, insert HTML comment code that is used by plugins to replace text or perform certain actions.

## RDF

Resource Description Framework. A language used to describe the locations of resources on the web. WordPress can produce output in RDF format that describes the locations of posts. Like [RSS](#rss), RDF is used for content syndication.

## Recordset

**Recordset** refers to the group of records or result returned from a database query.

- See also [MySQL](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL), [wpdb](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb) database class

## Relative Path

A **relative path** is the location of a file in relation to the current working directory and does not begin with a slash (/). This is different from an [absolute path](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Absolute_Path) which gives an exact location.

- See also: [Absolute Path](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Absolute_Path)
- External links: [Path\_Computing at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing))

## Relative URI

A relative URI (sometimes called a **relative link**) is a partial URI that is interpreted (resolved) relative to a **base URI**.

On the World Wide Web, relative URIs come in two forms:

A **relative URI with an absolute path** is interpreted relative to the domain root:

```
 /images/icecream.jpg <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">â</span> http://domain.example<strong>/images/icecream.jpg</strong>
```

A **relative URI with a relative path** is interpreted relative to the URL of the current document. E.g., on the web page *http://domain.example/icecream/chocolate.html*,

```
 <strong>strawberry.html</strong> <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">â</span> http://domain.example/icecream/<strong>strawberry.html</strong>
```

[Wikipedia: URI Resolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#URI_resolution)

## RichText

A common component enabling rich content editing including bold, italics, hyperlinks, etc.

## RSS

â*Really Simple Syndication*â: a format for syndicating many types of content, including blog entries, torrent files, video clips on news-like sites; specifically frequently updated content on a Web site, and is also known as a type of âfeedâ or âaggregatorâ. An RSS feed can contain a summary of content or the full text, and makes it easier for people to keep up to date with sites they like in an automated manner (much like e-mail).

The content of the feed can be read by using software called an [RSS or Feed reader](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#News_reader). Feed readers display hyperlinks, and include other metadata (information about information) that helps people decide whether they want to read more, follow a link, or move on.

The original intent of RSS is to make information come to you (via the feed reader) instead of you going out to look for it (via the Web).

Programs called news aggregators permit users to view many feeds at once, providing âpushâ content constantly. See [Category:Feeds](https://codex.wordpress.org/Category:Feeds) for Codex resources about bringing RSS feeds into WordPress. See also [RDF](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RDF) Site Summary.

## RTL

A written language is [Right-to-left](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left) when its script flows from the right side of the page to the left.

- Related articles: [Right-to-Left Language Support](https://codex.wordpress.org/Right-to-Left_Language_Support)

## Robots.txt

Web Robots are programs which traverse the Web automatically. They are also called Web Wanderers, Web Crawlers, and Spiders. Search Engines are the main Web Robots. Some Web Robots look for a file named **robots.txt** on your [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) to see what and where they should look for content and files on your web server. Some Web Robots ignore this file.

- Related articles: [Search Engine Optimization for WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Search_Engine_Optimization_for_WordPress)
- External links: [Google information about robots.txt](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40361), [The Web Robots Page](http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html)

## Role

A **role** gives users permission to perform a group of tasks. When a user logs in and is authenticated, the userâs role determines which [capabilities](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Capabilities) the user has, and each capability is permission to perform one or more types of task. All users with the same role normally have the same capabilities. For example, users who have the Author role usually have permission to edit their own posts, but not permission to edit other usersâ posts. WordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities in its role-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.

- Related article: [Roles and Capabilities](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities)
- External link: [Role-based access control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) (Wikipedia)

## Screen

In WordPress a **screen** is a web page used for managing part of a weblog ([site](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Site)) or [network](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Network). The term âscreenâ is used to avoid confusion with â[page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Page)â, which has a specific and different meaning in WordPress. For example, the web page used to manage posts is known as the [Posts Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Screen).

- Related article: [Class\_Reference/WP\_Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Screen)

## Serialization

The process of converting a blockâs attributes object into HTML markup, which occurs each time a block is edited.

## Settings Sidebar

The panel on the right that contains the document and block settings. The sidebar is toggled using the Settings gear icon. Block settings are shown when a block is selected, otherwise document settings are shown.

## Shell

A **shell** is a program which interacts directly with an operating system such as MS-DOS, [Unix](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix)/[Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux), [Mac OS X](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Mac_OS_X), or others â but it is most commonly associated with [Unices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unix). It is often referred to as a âconsoleâ or âcommand lineâ, because it is controlled using typed commands rather than mouse or graphical interface input.

Most often, when interacting with a remote computer (as one would when configuring WordPress), an additional âfauxâ shell is involved called [SSH](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#SSH).

Some popular shell programs are:

- [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html) (Bourne Again Shell)
- [Tcsh](http://tcsh.org/) (an expanded C Shell)
- [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/)

## Shortcode

A [Shortcode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) is a technique for embedding a snippet of [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP) code into the body of a page or other content item.

## Sidebar

A **sidebar** is a vertical column provided by a [theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Theme) for displaying information other than the main [content](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content) of the web page. Themes usually provide at least one sidebar at the left or right of the content. Sidebars usually contain [widgets](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Widget) that an administrator of the site can customize.

In a theme, sidebars are generated by a [template](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Template) file, typically named *sidebar.php*.

- See also: [Footer area](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Footer_area)
- Related articles: [Sidebars](https://codex.wordpress.org/Sidebars), [Templates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Templates), [Customizing Your Sidebar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_Your_Sidebar), [Stepping Into Templates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates), [Template Hierarchy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy)

## Site

In the WordPress user interface, a **site** can simply be the website created by WordPress, or it can be a virtual website created as part of a [network](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Network) by the [multisite](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Multisite) feature. A site in a network is virtual in the sense that it does not have its own directory on the server, although it has its own URL and it might have its own domain name.

In WordPress code the site is the website created by WordPress. If multisite is in use, then the site is the network website and each virtual website is known as a *blog*.

- Related article: [Create A Network](https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network)

## Site Editor

The cohesive experience that allows you to directly edit and navigate between various templates, template parts, styling options, and more.

## Slug

A **slug** is a few words that describe a post or a page. Slugs are usually a URL friendly version of the post title (which has been automatically generated by WordPress), but a slug can be anything you like. Slugs are meant to be used with [permalinks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Permalink) as they help describe what the content at the URL is.

Example post permalink: *[\#development/2006/06/wordpress-203](#development/2006/06/wordpress-203)*

The slug for that post is âwordpress-203â.

Slugs are also used for post types, categories, tags, etc. Like post and page slugs, this is usually for creating URL friendly versions of these items.

## Smileys

[![Wink Icon](https://codex.wordpress.org/images/4/4b/icon_wink.gif)](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:icon_wink.gif)Smileys (also called Smilies or Emoticons) are stylized representations of a human face, usually displayed as yellow buttons with two dots for the eyes, and a half mouth. Smileys are often used in WordPress Plugins. By default, WordPress automatically converts text smileys to graphic images. When you type ð in your post you see when you preview or publish your post.

Related article: [Using Smilies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Smilies)

## Spam

Once upon a time, [SPAM](http://www.hormel.com) was an animal by-product that came in a can and was fodder for many Monty Python sketches, but since the world-wide adoption of the internet as an integral part of daily life, Spam has become synonymous with what is wrong with the internet. Spam, in general terms, is an email or other forms of unsolicited advertising. Spam is very easy to spread throughout the internet, and works on the principle that if you send out thousands, or hundreds of thousands of unsolicited advertisements, scams, or other questionable methods of making money, that you only need a very small percentage of people to be fooled and you will make lots of money.

Common spam these days comes from online gambling sites and those trying to sell drugs for âmale enhancement.â Lately, web logs, or blogs, as we call them, have been targeted by spammers to try to increase their site ratings in the search engines. Spammers use various methods to distribute their electronic junk mail, and employ bots, or computer programs to quickly and easily send email or comments to millions of addresses and [IPs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address) all over the world.

Spammers can be difficult to track down as they often hijack peoplesâ email and [IP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#IP_address) addresses. When this happens, it may appear a friend sent you the spam, but in fact, the spammerâs [bot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) grabbed your friendâs email address and used it to hide the true source of the spam. WordPress [developers](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Developer) and community members are constantly working on more and better ways to combat these annoying **spammers** as they clog the internet with their garbage. You can help by offering your talents, ideas, suggestions, or just by being vigilant and installing any of the [currently-available spam combating tools](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam).

- External links: [SPAM at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPAM)

## SSH

**SSH** stands for Secure Shell. It is a communication protocol for connecting to remote computers over TCP/IP. Various authentication methods can be used which make SSH more secure than [Telnet](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Telnet).

## SSL

**SSL** stands for Secure Sockets Layer and is the predecessor to Transport Layer Security. These are cryptographic protocols for secure communications across an unsecured network like the Internet.

- External links: [SSL at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer)

## Static block

A type of block where the content of which is known at the time of saving a post. A static block will be saved with HTML markup directly in post content.

## Stats

**Stats** are a record showing how many views and visitors a WordPress blog or website gets during a set period of time. Stats also show where in the world your viewers are.

## String

In computer science a string is any finite sequence of characters (i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks). Typically, programmers must enclose strings in quotation marks for the data to be recognized as a string and not a number or variable name.

- External links: [String at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science))

## Structure tags

These tags are used to customize WordPress permalinks. Structure tags are: %year%, %day%, %hour%, %minute%, %second%, %post\_id%, %postname%, %category% and %author%. End permalink structure with either %post\_id% or %postname%, so that each permalink points to an individual post.

- Related articles: [Permalinks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Permalinks)

## Subversion

[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) is an [open-source](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Open_Source) [version control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) software tool used by the [WordPress Developers](https://codex.wordpress.org/Copyright_Holders) to maintain and track the changes and updates to the various WordPress versions.

- External links: [Subversion access at wordpress.org](#download/svn), [Subversion book at red-bean.com](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)

## SVC

**SVC** stands for Switched Virtual Circuit. An SVC is a virtual circuit that is temporary turned on during a session of data transfer.

- External links: [Virtual circuit at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_circuit)

## Syndication

See RSS: [Really Simple Syndication](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#RSS)

[Back to the Top](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#top)

## Tag

A Tag is a keyword which describes all or part of a Post. Think of it like a [Category](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category), but smaller in scope. A Post may have several tags, many of which relate to it only peripherally. Like Categories, Tags are usually linked to a page which shows all Posts having the same Tag. Tags can be created on-the-fly by simply typing them into the [Tag field](https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_Posts#Post_Tags). By default, tags can be assigned only to the *Post* and custom [post types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_types).

Tags can also be displayed in [clouds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_Cloud) which show large numbers of Tags in various sizes, colors, etc. This allows for a sort of total perspective on the blog, allowing people to see the sort of things your blog is about most.

Many people confuse Tags and Categories, but the difference is easy: Categories generally donât change often, while your Tags usually change with every Post and are closer to the topic of the Post.

## Tagline

A tagline is a catchy phrase that describes the character or the attributes of the blog in a brief, concise manner. Think of it as the slogan, or catchline for a weblog.

## Task Based Documentation

Task based, or task oriented documentation is writing that takes you through a process/task step-by-step; it is succinct, lacks jargon, is easily understood, and structured entirely around performing specific tasks. In order to get to Z, you need to:

1. Step x
2. Step y
3. Step z

Keep in mind that people who need to know how to perform a task usually need answers quick!

## Taxonomy

A **taxonomy** allows for the classification of things. In WordPress, there are two built-in taxonomies, categories and tags. These taxonomies help further classify posts and custom post types. Also, custom taxonomies can be defined.

- See also: [Category](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category), [Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Tag)
- External links: [Taxonomy at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy), [register\_taxonomy()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy)

## Telnet

Telnet is a [communications protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) used to establish a connection to another computer. *Telnet* runs on top of [TCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)/[IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) and is typically used in conjuction with terminal emulation software to login to remote computers. Telnet is inherently insecure and has largely been replaced by [SSH](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#SSH)

- External links: [Telnet at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet)

## Template

In WordPress a **template** is a file that defines an area of the web pages generated by a [theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Theme). For example, there is typically a template for the header area at the top of the web pages, a template for the [content](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Content), a template for the [sidebars](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Sidebar), and so on. The templates are like building blocks that make up the complete web page.

- Related articles: [Templates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Templates), [Stepping Into Templates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Templates), [Template Hierarchy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy)

## Template Editing Mode

A scaled down direct editing experience allowing you to edit/change/create the template a post/page uses.

## Template Tag

In a WordPress Theme, [template tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) are used in template files to generate specific programming instructions. They are used to display generated content and information on a WordPress site. Template tags are short programming words, also known as functions, that tap into the WordPress core for instructions. For example, the HTML title tag of a WordPress site may hold the [bloginfo()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/bloginfo) template tag that requests the site title, site tagline, and other site information set by the template tag parameters. Using this in the title HTML tag allows the Theme to be used on multiple sites and the information displayed will change easily with each site.

Other template tags are more sophisticated, generating post content, queries, and site data.

- Related articles: [Stepping Into Template Tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping_Into_Template_Tags), [Anatomy of a Template Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Anatomy_of_a_Template_Tag), [How to Pass Tag Parameters](https://codex.wordpress.org/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters), [Include Tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Include_Tags), [Conditional Tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags), [Function Reference](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference), [Templates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Templates)

## Term

In WordPress, a **term** is a classification, group or subset of a [Taxonomy](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Taxonomy), where the latter can be a [Category](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category), [Tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Tag) or Custom Taxonomy. By default, terms have a title, a slug and a description. Hierarchical taxonomies like categories can define a parent term.

- Related articles: [Taxonomies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies), [the\_terms()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/the_terms)

## Text editor

A **text editor** is a program which edits files in *plain text* format, as compared to *binary* format. Using a non-text based word processing program (e.g. using Microsoft Word to edit [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP) scripts) can cause major problems in your code. This is because non-text based word processing programs insert extra formatting into text files, and can corrupt the files when they need to be interpreted by the interpreter. An editor like Notepad does not insert any extra formatting.

**Edit WordPress Files with a text only editor.**

Some examples of file formats which need to be edited as plain text:

- [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) documents
- [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP) scripts
- [Perl](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Perl) scripts
- Rich Text Format documents
- [JavaScript](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#JavaScript) scripts

For our recommended Text Editors, please see [Editing Files](#documentation/article/editing-files).

Some examples of non-plain text formats that require special software for editing:

- Microsoft Word documents
- Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
- Images, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF

Some examples of software which can edit text, but which are **NOT** regarded as basic text editors and **NOT recommended** for use on WordPress files:

- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft Excel
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- Adobe Dreamweaver

## Theme

A Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical front-end interface with an underlying unifying design for a site. A WordPress Theme modifies the way the site is displayed and designed, without modifying the underlying core programming of WordPress. While some associate a WordPress Theme with âskinningâ your site with a design, a WordPress Theme contains programming code that influences the design, changing it with each generated page view based upon the programming with PHP, WordPress template tags, WordPress conditional tags, and CSS.

- Related articles: [Theme Development](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development), [Using Themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes)

## Theme Blocks

Blocks that accomplish everything possible in traditional templates using template tags (ex: Post Author Block). A full list can be found [here](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/22724).

## TinyMCE

[TinyMCE](https://www.tinymce.com/) is a web-based JavaScript WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor.

## Toolbar

The **Toolbar** is an area of the screen just above that site that lists useful admininstration screen links such as add a new post or edit your profile. The Toolbar was added in [Version 3.1](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.1) as [Admin Bar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Admin_Bar) and in [Version 3.3](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.3) it was replaced by the [Toolbar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Toolbar). The toolbar can be turned on/off from the [User Profile Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Your_Profile_SubPanel).

- Related articles: [Toolbar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Toolbar)
- See also: [Admin Bar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Admin_Bar), [Your Profile Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Your_Profile_SubPanel)

## Toolbar (in FSE)

A set of button controls. In the context of a block, usually referring to the toolbar of block controls shown above the selected block.

## Trackback

Trackback helps you to notify another author that you wrote something related to what he had written on his blog, even if you donât have an explicit link to his article. This improves the chances of the other author sitting up and noticing that you gave him credit for something, or that you improved upon something he wrote, or something similar. With pingback and trackback, blogs are interconnected. Think of them as the equivalents of acknowledgements and references at the end of an academic paper, or a chapter in a textbook.

- See also: [Pingback](#documentation/article/glossary)
- Related articles: [Introduction to Blogging: Trackbacks](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging)

## Transient

A **Transient** is temporal data identified by a custom name, stored in the [web server](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) database or memory for fast access. This temporal nature and use of fast memory caching is their primary distinction from [Options](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Options).

- Related articles: [Transients API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Transients_API), [Options API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API)

## Unicode

A widely supported and preferred character encoding system.

For a computer to display letters (or any text characters), it needs to enumerate them â create an index of characters it knows how to display. These indexes are known as character sets. This is invaluable for users hosting [WordPress in a non-English language](https://codex.wordpress.org/Localization).

The most widely used collections of these character sets are the [iso-8859](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859) with [iso-8859-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1) and [iso-8859-15](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-15) (which contains the euro sign) being the most common; they are also known as Latin1 and Latin9. These character sets use 8 bits (a single byte) for each character, allowing for 255 different characters (256, counting null). However, when considering that Latin-based languages arenât the only ones in the world (think Japanese or Hebrew), 255 characters arenât nearly enough.

There is a wide index of characters known as [Unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). Unicode has so many characters that sometimes more than 16 bits (2 bytes!) are required to represent them. Furthermore, the first 127 characters of Unicode are the same as the first 127 of the most widely used character set â iso-8859-1. For this purpose, UTF, the Unicode Translation Format, was created. UTF uses different numbers of bits for characters, and allows for the entire range of Unicode to be used. What you should probably know is:

- UTF-8 is an 8-bit-minimum type of UTF. There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32.
- If your document is in a Latin-based encoding, you probably donât need to change anything about it for it to be UTF.
- A single UTF document can be in various languages with no need to switch encodings halfway through.
- External links: [Joel Spolsky on Unicode](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html)

## Unix

**Unix**, or **UNIX**, is a computer operating system developed at AT&amp;Tâs Bell Laboratories starting back in 1969. Initially designed with the objective of creating an OS written in a high level language rather than assembly, a majority of [web servers](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Web_server) currently run on different âflavorsâ of this high-performance OS, or on [Linux](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Linux), developed as a Unix-like operating system.

- See also: [UNIX Shell Skills](https://codex.wordpress.org/UNIX_Shell_Skills), [Mac OS X](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Mac_OS_X)

## Unix Time

**Unix Time**, or a **timestamp**, is a method of tracking time by determining the approximate number of seconds from a particular event. That event is called an Epoch. Since this time format is only off by a few seconds each century, it is usually considered good enough for most applications.

Unix time is (currently) a ten digit number, and looks like this: 1229362315. WordPress often uses a Unix timestamp internally to track time. The human readable times and dates you see are converted from Unix Time or from a MySQL/MariaDB DATETIME field.

- External Links: [Unix Time at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), [DATETIME](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/datetime.htmllMySQL), [MariaDB DATETIME](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/datetime/)

## URL

An address of a specific Web site or file on the Internet.

```
 http://www.example.com/
 http://www.example.com/reports/index.html
```

## UTC

**UTC** (âUniversal Time, Coordinatedâ) is the basis of international time standards from which time zones around the world are calculated. For most purposes it is the same as the older [GMT](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#GMT) standard.

- External link: [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) (Wikipedia)

## Web server

A **web server** is a computer containing software for, and connected to infrastructure for, *hosting*, or serving, web sites written in [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML). The most common web server software on the internet is [Apache](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Apache), which is frequently used in conjunction with [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP), [Perl](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Perl), and other scripting languages.

It is possible to create oneâs own web server, hosted on any speed of internet connection, but many people choose to purchase packages from [hosting providers](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Hosting_provider), who have the capacity and facilities to provide adequate bandwidth, uptime, hardware, and maintenance for frequently-visited web sites.

## Widget

In WordPress a **widget** is a self-contained area of a web page that performs a specific function, or the code that generates such a self-contained area. For example, WordPress has a built-in widget that displays a list of pages in a weblogâs [sidebar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Sidebar), and it has another built-in widget that displays a list of recent comments in the [Dashboard](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Dashboard). Plugins and themes can provide additional widgets.

### Widget Area

Furthermore, a âWidget Areaâ is a pre-defined location, in the code of your WordPress Theme, that allows users to place Widgets into.

## XFN

[The XHTML Friends Network](http://gmpg.org/xfn). A decentralised project to have inter-blog links that represent relationships between bloggers. XFN links resemble `<a href="http://www.photomatt.net/" rel="friend met">Photo Matt</a>`.

## XHTML

**XHTML**, or **Extensible HyperText Markup Language**, is the successor to [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) as the [W3C](http://www.w3.org) standard language with which all web pages are created. It is often used in conjunction with [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CSS) and [JavaScript](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#JavaScript).

WordPress strives to conform to the XHTML 1.0 Transitional standard.

- External links: [XHTML 1.0 Specification (Second Edition)](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/), [XHTML 1.1 Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/)

## XML

**XML**, or **Extensible Markup Language**, is written in Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and essentially allows you to define your own markup language. XML is extremely useful in describing, sharing, and transmitting data across the Internet. Typically used in conjunction with [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML), XML defines data and [HTML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#HTML) displays that data.

## XML-RPC

**XML-RPC** is **Extensible Markup Language-Remote Procedure Call**. A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) allows you to call (or request) another application and expect that application to honor the request (answer the call). So, **XML-RPC** allows a user (or [developer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Developer)) to send a request, formatted in [XML](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#XML), to an external application.

# Search Engine Optimization <a name="documentation/article/search-engine-optimization" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-engine-optimization/

WordPress, straight out of the box, comes ready to embrace search engines. Its features and functions guide a search engine through the posts, pages, and categories to help the search engine crawl your site and gather the information it needs to include your site within its database.

WordPress comes with several built in search optimization tools, including the ability to use [.htaccess](/support/article/glossary#htaccess) to create apparently static [URLs](/support/article/glossary/#url) called [permalinks](/support/article/using-permalinks/), [blogrolling](/support/article/glossary/#blogroll), and [pinging](/support/article/glossary/#pingback). There are also a number of third party [plugins](/support/article/plugins/) and hacks which can be used for search engine optimization (SEO).

However, once you start using various [WordPress Themes](/support/article/using-themes/) and [customizing WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout) to meet your own needs, you may break some of those useful search engine friendly features. To maintain your WordPress siteâs optimal friendliness towards search engine spiders and crawlers, here are a few tips:

**Good, Clean Code**

Make sure your siteâs code [validates](https://codex.wordpress.org/Validating_a_Website). Errors in your code may prevent a search engine from moving through the site successfully.

**Content Talks**

Search engines canât âseeâ a site. They can only âreadâ a site. Looks do not talk to a search engine. What âtalksâ to a search engine are the words, the content, the material in your site that explains, shares, informs, educates, and babbles. Make sure you have quality **word** content for a search engine to examine and compare with all the parts and pieces to give you a good âscoreâ.

**Write Your Content with Searchers in Mind**

How do you find information on the Internet? If you are writing something that you want to be âfoundâ on the Internet, think about the words and phrases someone would use to find your information. Use them more than once as you write, but not in every sentence. Learn how search engines scan your content, evaluate it, and categorize it so you can help yourself get in good favor with search engines.

**Content First**

A search engine enters your site and, for the most part, ignores the styles and [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/CSS). It just plows through the site gathering content and information. Most WordPress Themes are designed with the content as close to the top of the unstyled page as possible, keeping sidebars and footers towards the bottom. Few search engines scan more than the first third of the page before moving on. Make sure your Theme puts the content near the top.

**Keywords, Links, and Titles Meet Content**

Search engines do not evaluate your site on how pretty it is, but they do evaluate the words and put them through a sifter, giving credit to certain words and combinations of words. Words found within your document are compared to words found within your links and titles. The more that match, the better your âscore.â

**Content in Links and Images**

Your site may not have much text, mostly photographs and links, but you have places in which to add textual content. Search engines look for `alt` and `title` in link and image tags. While these have a bigger purpose of making your site more accessible, having good descriptions and words in these attributes helps provide more content for search engines to digest.

**Link Popularity**

It is not how good your site is, it is how good the sites are that link to you. This still holds weight with search engine favoritism. Itâs about who links to you. [Blogrolls](/support/article/glossary/#blogroll), [pingbacks](/support/article/glossary/#pingback), and [trackbacks](/support/article/glossary/#trackback) are all built into WordPress. These help you link to other people, which gives them credit, but it also helps them link to you, connecting the âlinks.â The number of incoming links your site has that have been recognized by Google can be checked by typing `link:www.yoursite.com` into Google (other search engines have similar functions). Other ways to generate incoming links to your site include:

- Add your siteâs url to your signature on forum posts on other sites.
- Submit your site to directories (see below).
- Note: Leaving comments on blogs will not help with this, since all modern blogging tools use the [rel=ânofollowâ](https://codex.wordpress.org/Nofollow) attribute. Donât be a [comment spammer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam).

**Good Navigation Links**

A search engine crawls through your site, moving from page to page. [Good navigational links](https://codex.wordpress.org/Good_Navigation_Links) to the categories, archives, and various pages on your site will invite a search engine to move gracefully from one page to another, following the connecting links and visiting most of your site.

## Get the Blog Indexed in Google Search

Before getting to the details on how you can get Google to recognize you, we need to first understand these three terms:

- The Googlebot: This is the software used to search that is used by Google to gather new information that has been uploaded online so that it can be fed on Google pages. Once information that you had uploaded is picked up by this software, then it can be found on Google pages.
- Crawling: This is the process where the above named software, Googlebot, roams from site to site detecting any new information to be uploaded on Google. This software works by going through new links that have been uploaded recently and which are generating a lot of traffic.
- Indexing: Once the information has been gathered by the Googlebot through the process called crawling, it is processed through another process called indexing. It is through this process that the quality of content is determined so that they can be placed appropriately on Google pages. The question now is, how exactly does Googlebot find this information? Firstly, it starts by siting the web pages that it had cited in the previous search. It then detects new pages associated with those old ones or just new ones all together. More details on the same would be found on Search Console help for those who are interested in the same. Any new information is cited with the help of sitemaps and links that lead to those articles.

## Search Engine Site Submissions

There are many resources that will âhelpâ you submit your site to search engines. Some are free, some for a fee. Or you can manually submit your site to search engines yourself. Whatever method you choose to use, once your site has been [checked for errors](https://codex.wordpress.org/Validating_a_Website) and is ready to go, search engines will welcome your WordPress site.

Here are some tips for successful site submissions:

- Make sure you have content for search engines to scan. In general, have more than 10 posts on your site to give the search engines something to examine and evaluate.
- Do not submit your site to the same search engine more than once a month or longer, depending upon their criteria, not your anxiousness to be listed.
- Have ready to type, or copy and paste, the title of the site, and the categories your site may belong to in a search engine directory.
- Have a list of your websiteâs various âaddresses/URLsâ ready. You can submit your root directory as well as specific categories and feeds to search engines, expanding your search engine coverage.
- Keep a list of the various search engines and directories you submit to so you do not accidentally resubmit too soon, and you can keep track of how they include you among their pages and results.

**Directory Sites**

It is also useful for traffic generation and search optimization purposes to submit your site to directories. Both comprehensive directory sites and those specific to the subject or localisation of your site can be used.

## Search Engine Optimization Resources

While WordPress comes ready for search engines, the following are more resources and information you may want to know about preparing and maintaining your site for search enginesâ robots and crawlers.

### Meta Tags

[Meta Tags](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Meta Tags in WordPress>) contain information that describes your siteâs purpose, description, and keywords used within your site. The meta tags are stored within the `head` of your `header.php` template file. By default, they are not included in WordPress, but you can manually include them and the article on [Meta Tags in WordPress](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Meta Tags in WordPress>) takes you through the process of adding meta tags to your WordPress site.

The WordPress [Custom Fields](/support/article/custom-fields/) option can also be used to include keywords and descriptions for [posts](/support/article/writing-posts/) and [Pages](/support/article/pages/). There are also several WordPress Plugins that can also help you to add meta tags and keyword descriptions to your site found within the [Official WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins).

### Robots.txt Optimization

Search Engines read a file at `yourdomain.com/robots.txt` to get information on what they should and shouldnât check.

Adding entries to robots.txt to help SEO is popular misconception. Google says you are welcome to use robots.txt to block parts of your site but these days prefers you donât. Use page-level noindex tags instead, to tackle low-quality parts of your site. Since 2009, Google has been evermore vocal in its advice to avoid blocking JS &amp; CSS files, and Googleâs Search Quality Team has been evermore active in promoting a policy of transparency by webmasters, to help Google verify weâre not âcloakingâ or linking to unsightly spam on blocked pages. Therefore the ideal robots file disallows nothing whatsoever, and may link to an XML Sitemap if an accurate one has been constructed (which itself is rare though!).

WordPress by default only blocks a couple of JS files but is nearly compliant with Googleâs guidance here.

- [wikipedia â Robots.txt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt)

### Feed Submissions

WordPress comes built-in with various [feeds](<https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress Feeds>), allowing your site to be viewed by various feed readers. Many search engines are now accepting feed submissions, and there are many site which specialize in directories of feeds and feed services.

To submit your siteâs feeds, you need to know the link to the various feeds your site provides. The article [WordPress Feeds](<https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress Feeds>) lists the various links of the feeds that come built into WordPress.

For information on customizing these links, see the article on [Customizing Feeds](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing Feeds>).

### Permalinks

[Permalinks](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/#pretty-permalinks) are enhancements to your existing URLs which can improve search engine optimization by presenting your post, page, and archive URLs as something like `<nowiki>http://example.com/2003/05/23/my-cheese-sandwich/</nowiki>` rather than `<nowiki>http://example.com/index.php?p=423</nowiki>`. See [Using Permalinks](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Using Permalinks>) for more information.

As search engines use links and the `title` as part of their information gathering, links to posts and articles within your site gain importance with Permalinks.

### Sitemaps

A *sitemap* or âsite mapâ is a single page listing of all the posts on your website. It is intended for your visitors to get a good overview on what your site is about and to find a blog post quickly but it also has great benefits in the search engines as a good link is always pointing to all your blog posts. By having a link to your sitemap on all your sites pages both visitors and search engines will easily get to it and find all your posts.

### Google Sitemaps

As of June 2005, Google is now accepting **sitemaps** of your site as part of their website submissions. Google needs to have this sitemap formatted in a special way using XML. You can find more information about [Googleâs Sitemap Submissions](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en) from Google, and the discussion on the [WordPress Forum](/support/forums) about [WordPress and Google Site maps](#support/topic/35465).

Some utilities have been created to help the WordPress user to create a Google site map of their site for submission to Google. For more information on these and Google sitemaps:

- [Inside Google Sitemaps (Official Google Blog)](http://sitemaps.blogspot.com/)

### Link Relationships

There is some debate over whether listing the link relations actually effect search engine ranking however it is simple to implement.

# Administer your Blog <a name="documentation/article/administer-your-blog" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administer-your-blog/

Generally, the daily tasks associated with administering your WordPress site are quick and easy to do, freeing you to concentrate on the content, editorials, and stories you want to share with the world, and allowing you to get back to other activities.

Here is a quick look at the various activities involved in administering your WordPress site. Some of these may need to be done daily, while others can be done weekly, monthly, or less frequently. It depends upon your blogging activity level and the intent of your WordPress site.

## Daily Tasks

### Login and Write

Most people begin by logging into their WordPress site because they have news, information, or a story to tell. So they head straight for the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#add-new-post) &gt; [Add New](/support/article/writing-posts/). There, the title is set, the information is entered, categories and tags chosen, and any other minor details noted, and with a click is published.

If you have any new images, movies, or music, to upload to your site, you can easily to that when writing the post or switch to the ï»¿[Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Media](/support/article/administration-screens/#media-add-pictures-and-movies-to-your-posts) &gt; [Add New Screen](/support/article/using-images/) and add any other images to your WordPress site. Then, you can either add these to your new posts, or visit the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#add-new-post) &gt; [Posts screen](/support/article/posts-screen/) and click Edit to edit the post in which you now wish to add an image. Again, click SAVE and it is released to the world.

Also, there are those [Drafts](/support/article/post-status/#draft) sitting up at the top of the Write Post screen, which you can publish or move to the trash, if youâd like.

Luckily with WordPress, you have some options for dealing with all those posts. They donât all have to be released today. Many people work ahead with their blog content, setting the dates into the future. When the day and time arrives, WordPress will automatically release the post, without any additional effort from you.

### Checking Comments

After you have cleaned up the content on your site, it is time to find out what they have been saying about what you say. On the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Comments Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comments_Screen), you can inspect the comments posted to your site. If a comment has been marked for [moderation approval](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation), it will look lighter colored than the rest of the comments. Click [Edit Comment](https://codex.wordpress.org/Manage_Comments_SubPanel#View_Mode) to access the comment and set it to be approved. Click **Delete Comment** if you want it removed.

The [Moderation Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Awaiting_Moderation_SubPanel) will segregate the comments awaiting moderation from the rest of the comments if you have set your [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) &gt; [Discussion](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) to moderate all comments. This allows for quick and easy comment moderation.

Determining which comments to keep and delete is a challenge. Be aware that often nice comments like *âI really like your site. Keep up the great work.â* and *âIt shows you put a lot of time and effort in this. Thanks.â* might be benign comments, or more likely comment [spam](/support/article/glossary/#spam). To help you determine and check on what might be comment spam, and how to increase your protection against comment spammers, check out the following documents:

- [Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam)
- [Moderating Comments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation)
- [Combating Comment Spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam)
- [Denying Access to Comment Spammers with .htaccess](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam/Denying_Access)

### Users and Authors

If you have set your site set up to [allow users to register](https://codex.wordpress.org/Registered_User_Features) and submit articles, stop by your [Users Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/#users-your-blogging-family) to check on those who have registered and make any adjustments to their [User Roles and Capabilities](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/) as needed.

If you do allow users to post articles, be sure to check the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#add-new-post) &gt; [Posts screen](/support/article/posts-screen/) for any newly posted articles in the **Drafts** or **Pending** status awaiting your review and release.

### Check the Dashboard

At this point, your daily tasks are almost complete. Your site is up-to-date and on its way to entertaining and educating the world. But, there is one last task you might want to check. Stop by your WordPress [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Dashboard](/support/article/administration-screens/#dashboard-information-central) &gt; [Dashboard](/support/article/dashboard-screen/) screen and check to see if there are any new activities going on in the WordPress Community, especially any announcements about upgrades.

While there, take advantage of your handy âTo Do Listâ featured on the Dashboard. This lists your most recently released posts, the next batch of scheduled entries, recent comments, blog stats, and incoming links (referrers). This helpful information lets you know what has been released to the public from your site, what is next on the list, and shows you, at a glance, to view the most recent comments.

The blog stats and incoming links give you different information. The Stats give you information about how many posts, comments, and categories are on your site. While this may not be critical information, you can use it as a general scoreboard or counter. The incoming links information tells you who has [pinged](/support/article/glossary/#pingback) or [trackbacked](/support/article/glossary/#trackback) your site. This helps your link popularity for your site and gives you an idea of who thought your siteâs material was worthy of praise.

At the bottom of the page, you will see a list of your Drafts, waiting to be done.

## Administration Tasks

As the administrator or site owner, there are a few more tasks you should add to your schedule. These do not have to be done daily, but they still need to be done on a regular basis. Many of these are outlined in the articles [WordPress Housekeeping](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Housekeeping) and [WordPress Site Maintenance](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Site_Maintenance). In general they are:

- [Updating WordPress](/support/article/updating-wordpress/)
- Check for Dead Links Throughout Your Site
- [Check in with WordPress for Changes and Information](https://www.wordpress.org/)
- [Backup Your WordPress Site and Database](/support/article/backing-up-your-database/)
- [Update Your Siteâs Content and/or Look](/support/article/using-themes/)
- Update [Plugins](/plugins/managing-plugins/) and [Themes](/support/article/using-themes/)
- [Check for Validation Errors](https://codex.wordpress.org/Validating_a_Website)
- [Optimize Your WordPress Site](/support/article/optimization/)

# What are smilies? <a name="documentation/article/what-are-smilies" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/

## What Are Smileys?

Smileys, also known as âemoticonsâ, are *glyphs* used to convey emotions in your writing. They are a great way to brighten up posts. ð

Text smileys are created by typing two or more punctuation marks. Some examples are:

`;-)` is equivalent to ð

`:-)` is equivalent to ð

`:-(` is equivalent to ð

`:-?` is equivalent to ð

To learn more about emoticons and their history, see the [Wikipedia entry on Emoticons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons).

### Smileys are not Emoji

Although smileys and emoji can both display smiley faces and such, emoji are a newer development and have a much wider range of images that can be displayed. (They are also created differently.) For more information on emoji and how to use them, see the [Emoji](https://codex.wordpress.org/Emoji) page.

## How Does WordPress Handle Smileys?

By default, WordPress automatically converts text smileys to graphic images. When you type `;-)` in your post you see ð when you preview or publish your post.

## To Turn off Graphic Smileys

As of WordPress 4.3, the option to disable graphic smileys was removed from new installs. There is [a plugin](#plugins/keep-emoticons-as-text) if you want to retain the option.

## What Text Do I Type to Make Smileys?

Smiley images and the text used to produce them\*:

| icon | text | text | full text | icon | full text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ð | `:)` | `:-)` | `:smile:` | ð | `:lol:` |
| ð | `:D` | `:-D` | `:grin:` | ð³ | `:oops:` |
| ð | `:(` | `:-(` | `:sad:` | ð¥ | `:cry:` |
| ð® | `:o` | `:-o` | `:eek:` | ð¿ | `:evil:` |
| ð¯ | `8O` | `8-O` | `:shock:` | ð | `:twisted:` |
| ð | `:?` | `:-?` | `:???:` | ð | `:roll:` |
| ð | `8)` | `8-)` | `:cool:` | â | `:!:` |
| ð¡ | `:x` | `:-x` | `:mad:` | â | `:?:` |
| ð | `:P` | `:-P` | `:razz:` | ð¡ | `:idea:` |
| ð | `:\|` | `:-\|` | `:neutral:` | â¡ | `:arrow:` |
| ð | `;)` | `;-)` | `:wink:` | ![:mrgreen:](https://wordpress.org/documentation/wp-includes/images/smilies/mrgreen.png) | `:mrgreen:` |

*\* In some instances, multiple text options are available to display the same smiley.*

Category:Getting Started

## Troubleshooting Smileys

### Why Doesnât it Work?

Smileys may have been disabled by your WordPress admin. Another possibility is the smiley image files have been deleted from `/wp-includes/images/smilies`.

### Why Doesnât it Work for Me?

*If smileys work for others at your site but not for you:*

Type a space before and after your smiley text. That prevents the smiley being accidentally included in the text around it. ð³

Make sure not to use quotes or other punctuation marks before and after the smiley text. ð

### Where Are My Smiley Images Kept?

The smiley or emoticon image graphics are found in the `/wp-includes/images/smilies` directory.

Note that smileys is spelled âeysâ in this documentation and the directory name for the smiley images is *âsmilies*, spelled âiesâ. ð¯

### How Can I Have Different Smiley Images Appear?

The easiest way is to filter the smilies.

Upload the images you want with the same name to your server (say in wp-content/images/smilies) and put this in your themeâs function.php:

```

add_filter( 'smilies_src', 'my_custom_smilies_src', 10, 3 );
function my_custom_smilies_src( $img_src, $img, $siteurl )
{
        return $siteurl.'/wp-content/images/smilies/'.$img;
}
```

That will replace http://example.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon\_question.gif with http://example.com/wp-content/images/smilies/icon\_question.gif

### Why are my Smiley Images Blank?

If you recently uploaded the images, it could be that the images have been uploaded in ***ASCII*** format by your FTP program. Re-upload the smileys ensuring that they are transferred in ***BINARY*** format.

Some FTP programs have an **auto-detect** setting which will upload files in the correct format without user intervention. If you have such a setting, turn it on.

## Smiley CSS

The smiley images in WordPress are automatically given a [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#CSS) class of **wp-smiley** when they are displayed in a post. You can use this class to style your smileys differently from other post images.

For example, itâs not uncommon to set up images in a post to appear on the left-hand side of the content with text flowing around the image. The CSS for that might look like this:

```

.post img {
        float: left;
}
```

This would typically affect all images in a post, **including** your smiley images. To *override* this so that smileys stay inline, you could add this to your CSS:

```

img.wp-smiley {
        float: none;
}
```

# Use keyboard shortcuts (Classic Editor) <a name="documentation/article/keyboard-shortcuts-classic-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/keyboard-shortcuts-classic-editor/

## Editor Shortcuts

- **Note: This page lists keyboard Shortcuts for the Classic editor.**
- **For the Block Editor, [the list of Keyboard Shortcuts is here](#documentation/article/block-editor-keyboard-shortcuts)**

In the WordPress visual editor you can use a combination of keys to do things that normally need a mouse, trackpad or other input device. Rather than reaching for your mouse to click on the toolbar, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

Windows and Linux use âCtrl + letterâ, Mac uses âCommand (â) + letterâ.

### Ctrl + key

```
Letter Action<br></br>c ... Copy<br></br>v ... Paste<br></br>a ... Select all<br></br>x ... Cut<br></br>z ... Undo<br></br>y ... Redo<br></br>b ... Bold<br></br>i ... Italic<br></br>u ... Underline<br></br>k ... Insert/edit link<br></br>
```

### Alt + Shift + key

The following shortcuts use a different key combination: Windows/Linux: âAlt + Shift (â§) + letterâ. Mac: âCtrl + Option (alt â¥) + letterâ. (Macs running any WordPress version below 4.2 use âAlt + Shift (â§) + letterâ).

```
Letter Action<br></br>n ... Check Spelling (This requires a plugin.)<br></br>l ... Align Left<br></br>j ... Justify Text<br></br>c ... Align Center<br></br>d ... Strikethrough<br></br>r ... Align Right<br></br>u ... â¢ List<br></br>a ... Insert link<br></br>o ... 1. List<br></br>s ... Remove link<br></br>q ... Quote<br></br>m ... Insert Image<br></br>w ... Distraction Free Writing mode<br></br>t ... Insert More Tag<br></br>p ... Insert Page Break tag<br></br>h ... Help<br></br>x ... Add/remove code tag<br></br>1 ... Heading 1<br></br>2 ... Heading 2<br></br>3 ... Heading 3<br></br>4 ... Heading 4<br></br>5 ... Heading 5<br></br>6 ... Heading 6<br></br>9 ... Address
```

### Formatting Shortcuts

Formatting Shortcuts while using visual editor (Since [Version 4.3](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Version 4.3>))

```
Letter . Action<br></br>* ...... Start an unordered list<br></br>- ...... Start an unordered list<br></br>1. ..... Start an ordered list<br></br>1) ..... Start an ordered list<br></br>## ..... H2<br></br>### .... H3<br></br>#### ... H4<br></br>##### .. H5<br></br>###### . H6<br></br>> ...... transform text into blockquote<br></br>--- .... horizontal line<br></br>`..` ... transform text into code block
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts for Comments

Beginning with [WordPress Version 2.7](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Version 2.7>), the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to browse and moderate comments was introduced. These keyboard shortcuts are designed to save time by allowing you to rapidly navigate and perform actions on comments. If your blog gets a large number of comments, you will find these shortcuts especially useful.

### Activating Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are enabled on a per-user setting, and can be turned on by visiting the Profile panel in [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#your-profile) &gt; [Your Profile](/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/). Check the [Keyboard Shortcuts](/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/#your-profile-and-personal-options) checkbox to enable keyboard shortcuts for comment moderation.

Please note, the keyboard shortcuts are designed to use both hands, simultaneously, on a QWERTY style keyboard layout.

### The Meaning of Selected

The keyboard shortcuts are used for navigation and for actions. For any action to affect a comment, that comment must be first **selected**. The comment that is considered **selected** is indicated with a light-blue background. By default, no comment is selected, so, you will need to press either the letter **j** key, or letter **k** key, to start navigating.

### Using Keyboard Shortcuts to Navigate Comments

Navigating comments is accomplished with the **j** and **k** keys. When you first visit the Comments page, no comments is selected, so, first press the letter **j**, or the letter **k**, to select the first comment. After that, just press the letter **j** to move the select to the next comment.

- Pressing **j** moves the current selection (light-blue background) down.
- Pressing **k** moves the current selection (light-blue background) up.

Note that if you come to the bottom of a page of comments and press **j** again, you will be taken to the next page and the first comment of that next page will be selected. Likewise, pressing **k** at the top of a comment page will zoom you to the previous page, selecting the comment at the bottom of that previous page. This makes it very easy to navigate through a long list of comments to perform the necessary actions.

### Using Keyboard Shortcuts to Perform Actions on Comments

For one of these actions to affect a comment, make sure the comment is first selected (see above).

- Pressing **a** approves the currently selected comment.
- Pressing **s** marks the current comment as spam.
- Pressing **d** moves the comment to the trash (WordPress 2.9) or deletes the current comment.
- Pressing **z** restores the current comment from the trash or activates the Undo when that row is selected.
- Pressing **u** unapproves the currently selected comment, placing it back into moderation.
- Pressing **r** initiates an inline reply to the current comment (you can press **Esc** to cancel the reply).
- Pressing **q** activates âQuick Editâ which allows for rapid inline editing of the current comment.
- Pressing **e** navigates to the edit screen for the current comment.

### Bulk Actions

You can also perform an action on multiple comments at once. First, youâll need to select the comments for the bulk action, using the **x** key to check the checkbox for the currently selected comment. **Shift-x** can be used to toggle the checkboxes, inverting their state. Once you have some comments checked:

- Pressing **Shift-a** approves the checked comments.
- Pressing **Shift-s** marks the checked comments as spam.
- Pressing **Shift-d** deletes the checked comments.
- Pressing **Shift-u** unapproves the checked comments.
- Pressing **Shift-t** moves the checked comments to the Trash.
- Pressing **Shift-z** restores the checked comments from the Trash.

# Embeds <a name="documentation/article/embeds" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/embeds/

Since WordPress 5.0, the [WordPress block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) has an easy way to add videos, images, tweets, audio, and other content from third-party services into your WordPress site by embedding. An example of this is embedding a YouTube video in your post or page.

When you are embedding content, you donât need to upload the content to your WordPress site. You are creating a link to the content, from within your post or page.

Using the generic [Embed Block](#documentation/article/embed-block), you can paste the URL from the third-party site that you want to embed the content such as YouTube, Vimeo, TED, etc on your post or page.

![Embedding content using the Embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-16-at-11.31.14-AM-1024x429.png)You can also use Embed blocks build for specific third-party services such as YouTube Embed, Vimeo Embed, etc.

For a full list of embeds, check out the article: [list of all embed blocks](#documentation/article/blocks).

- **Facebook** and **Instagram**: Due to Facebookâs [decision to close the oEmbed end](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/09/22/facebook-and-instagram-embeds-to-be-deprecated-october-24th/)[ ](http://facebook%20announced%20updates%20to%20their%20marketing%20api/)point for embedding Facebook and Instagram links, the block will not work anymore after October 24, 2020. To embed Facebook and Instagram links into your site, you need a developer account and an appid, and provide an authentication token with their call to the endpoint. Refer to the [Facebook Documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development).
- **Tumblr** â only posts (name.tumblr.com/post/etc) are recognized, not standalone images (name.tumblr.com/image)
- **Twitter** â older versions of WordPress have issues with https embeds. Remove the âsâ from the https to fix the issue.
- **YouTube** â only public and âunlistedâ videos and playlists can be embedded. âprivateâ videos cannot be embedded.

# Audio Shortcode <a name="documentation/article/audio-shortcode" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/audio-shortcode/

The Audio feature allows you to embed audio files and play them back using a simple Shortcode. This was added as of WordPress 3.6 and is used like this:

```
[ audio]
```

Note: Do not put space between â\[â and âaudioâ.

You can also use build-in embeds and simply put the media file on its own line:

```
My cool content<br></br>http://my.mp3s.com/cool/songs/coolest.mp3<br></br>More cool content
```

## Usage

I have an old post that has an audio file in the Media Library attached to it, and I want to use the new shortcode:

```
[ audio]
```

Note: Do Not put Space between â\[â and âaudioâ.

I have the URL for an MP3, from the Media Library or external, that I want to play:

```
[audio src="audio-source.mp3"]
```

I have a source URL and fallbacks for other HTML5-supported filetypes:

```
[audio mp3="source.mp3" ogg="source.ogg" wav="source.wav"]
```

## Options

The following basic options are supported:

`src`  
([string](#documentation/article/glossary)) (optional) The source of your audio file. If not included it will auto-populate with the first audio file attached to the post. You can use the following options to define specific filetypes, allowing for graceful fallbacks:

# Image size and quality <a name="documentation/article/image-size-and-quality" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/image-size-and-quality/

The size and quality of an image for use on a web page is determined by a variety of things.

**Physical Size**

The physical size of an image is based upon two things: The size of the image on the screen and the file size. Generally, the file size is treated as a different issue.

**File Size**

This is the size of the file on your hard drive or server.

**Resolution**

*Resolution* refers to the number of pixels in an image. Resolution is sometimes identified by the width and height of the image as well as the total number of pixels in the image.

**File Type**

There are basically X image types popularly found on the Internet: `jpeg,gif,png` and (for [favicons](#documentation/article/create-a-favicon) (the icons next to the address)) `ico`.

The **physical size** of the image is information we need to know in order to determine how much âspaceâ will the image occupy on a web page. If your WordPress Theme features a fixed width content area of 600 pixels and the image you want to use is 800, the image will push the sidebar and layout of your web page around, messing up your design. Images within that 600 pixel width need to be restricted to that maximum width in order to protect the layout of your page. Itâs up to you to determine what size they should be from there, matching the image to your overall layout and styles.

**File size** dictates the time it takes to load your page, the larger the file size, often increased because of a high **image resolution** quality, the longer it will take to load. People often donât have the patience to wait through long web page loads, so keeping your file sizes low speeds up your web page access times. Typically, large high quality images should be kept between 100K and 60K. Smaller images should be closer to 30K and lower.

The **resolution** of the image dictates its clarity. The higher the resolution, though, the larger the file size, so you have to make a compromise between quality and file size.

Luckily, the various file types most commonly used on the Internet have *compression* features. When you save the file as one of these types, it condenses or *compresses* the data information in the image file. Internet browsers can *decompress* this information to display the image on the screen. Some graphic software programs allow you to set the compression rate to control the quality of the image (and file size) at the time you save it. Depending upon your use of the images on your site, you may have to experiment with this to get the right ratio that keeps the resolution quality good while maintaining a small file size.

Websites use four common **file types**. The end of a filename (called the *extension*) tells what type it is. One type, `ico`, is to make a *[favicon](#documentation/article/create-a-favicon)* file â but this is usually only done when a website is first set up. The other three types are used for general images:

- `jpg` (JPEG) is good for photographs. Saving a photo as `jpg` removes detail from the photo. Good photo editors let you control how much detail is removed (the âcompressionâ). Different photos need different compression; doing this carefully and viewing the result can give you a usable photo with a small file size.
- `gif` can be poor for photographs. Itâs better for line art, like logos, with solid areas of the same color.
- `png` is for both photographs and line art. It compresses photos without losing detail, but usually makes larger photo files than JPEGs. Some older browsers donât completely support `png`, though.

If you arenât sure which file type is best for a particular image, try saving the image in more than one type and comparing the file sizes. Using the right type can make a big difference! Thereâs more information in [Image file type and format guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types).

## Resizing Images

Not all graphic software packages allow you to resize images, though most should. Check your graphics software table of contents or index for *resize*, *size*, *transform*, *reduce*, or *enlarge*, all synonyms for the for the same thing. If they donât have the feature, you may have to find different software.

The process of resizing images is fairly simple. There are usually two methods:

1\) You can resize an image through the use of tools provided which allow you to manually shift the edges of an image to deform or resize the image. The best way is to grab a corner, not the edge, to resize the image. The corner âhandleâ will usually resize the image maintaining the overall height-width ratio. Check your manual for specific instructions.

2\) The other method involves simply specifying the imageâs final size. The advanced graphics programs allow you to set it by exact dimensions or a percentage of reduction or enlargement.

After resizing the image, the image may be smaller, but it may also be slightly out of focus. You can sharpen the focus of the small image by using the **sharpen** feature in your software.

When you have fine-tuned your small sized image or new thumbnail, export the image as a `jpg, gif,` or `png`.

# Hosting WordPress <a name="documentation/article/hosting-wordpress" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/hosting-wordpress/

To get your WordPress up and running, youâre going to need a web server. Most hosting providers have the technical specifications required for WordPress.

In general, hosting providers offer:

- *Generic* hosting, meant for different web applications (including WordPress, but also other software as well)
- *WordPress-specific* hosting

WordPress-specific hosting providers offer a platform designed for installing WordPress, or even pre-installed WordPress. They may also offer additional features such as backups, updates or developer tools.

See the subsection [Hosting providers](#documentation/article/hosting-wordpress) for more information and provider suggestions.

## Technical requirements

Please refer to [this page](#about/requirements) with the recommended server software. The page is updated with the latest minimum requirements to run WordPress. Youâll also find a pre-written letter you can use to contact a potential hosting provider.

If your server is not configured properly, your site may not function as intended, or you wonât be able to install WordPress. This is why ensuring your server meets the technical requirements is essential.

If you are new to WordPress, it may be a good idea to have your site hosted by a provider with experience in WordPress hosting.

## Hosting providers

Hosting is a commodity these days and with a little digging, itâs easy to find a hosting provider that fulfils the aforementioned requirements. If youâre looking for hosting suggestions, have a look at the following resources:

- [WordPress Recommended Hosts](#hosting) â these hosting service providers support WordPress, in more ways than one.
- Searching the WordPress [support forums](#support/forums) for recommendations.
- Chat with your local community WordPress [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) members and ask what they think!
- Chat with the Make WordPress community via [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).

# Post Status <a name="documentation/article/post-status" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/post-status/

Posts in WordPress can have one of a number of statuses. The status of a given post determines how WordPress handles that post. For instance, public posts viewable by everyone are assigned the publish status, while drafts are assigned the draft status. The status is stored in the post\_status field in the wp\_posts table.

WordPress provides 8 built-in statuses you can use. WordPress 3.0 gave you the capability to add your own custom post status and to use it in different ways.

## Workflow

WordPress provides built-in features that empower some users (based on their [Roles and Capabilities](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/)) to review content submitted to the website before it is published. This is commonly called âworkflow.â WordPressâs workflow features rely on the value of a postâs `post_status` field to know which step in the workflow process the post is currently held in.

Most users are already familiar with at least two workflow states:

- Posts that are published and visible to everyone (including users who are logged out) are given [the ](/support/article/post-status/#publish)`<a href="/support/article/post-status/#publish">publish</a>`[ status](/support/article/post-status/#publish).
- Drafts that are not yet published are assigned [the ](/support/article/post-status/#draft)`<a href="/support/article/post-status/#draft">draft</a>`[ status](/support/article/post-status/#draft).

Internally, WordPress sets the post status to `publish` when you click the âPublishâ button, and WordPress sets the post status to `draft` when you click the âSave Draftâ button. Similarly, if your website has users granted [the ](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#edit_posts)`<a href="/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#edit_posts">edit_posts</a>`[ capability](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#edit_posts) but not [the ](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#publish_posts)`<a href="/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#publish_posts">publish_posts</a>`[ capability](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#publish_posts), then when those users start writing a new post, WordPress will display a âSubmit for Reviewâ button instead of a âPublishâ button. Likewise, WordPress then assigns the post that user created [the ](/support/article/post-status/#pending)`<a href="/support/article/post-status/#pending">pending</a>`[ status](/support/article/post-status/#pending) when they press that button.

The status of a post can also be set in the [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/) and [Add New Posts](/support/article/writing-posts/) Screen by any user with the capability needed to assign the post to the given status. Internally, all of these posts are stored in the same place (the [`wp_posts`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description#Table:_wp_posts) table), and are differentiated by a column called `post_status`.

## Default Statuses

There are 8 major post statuses that WordPress uses by default.

### Publish

Viewable by everyone. (publish)

### Future

Scheduled to be published in a future date. (future)

### Draft

Incomplete post viewable by anyone with proper [user role](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/). (draft)

### Pending

Awaiting a user with the `publish_posts` capability (typically a user assigned [the ](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#editor)`<a href="/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#editor">Editor</a>`[ role](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#editor)) to publish. (pending)

### Private

Viewable only to WordPress users at Administrator level. (private)

### Trash

Posts in the Trash are assigned the `trash` status. (trash)

### Auto-Draft

[Revisions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Revisions) that WordPress saves automatically while you are editing. (auto-draft)

### Inherit

Used with a child post (such as [Attachments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Attachments) and [Revisions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Revisions)) to determine the actual status from the parent post. (inherit)

## Custom Status

**NOTICE:**This function does NOT add the registered post status to the Administration Screen. This functionality is pending future development. Please refer to [Trac Ticket #12706](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12706). Consider the action hook [post\_submitbox\_misc\_actions](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.1/wp-admin/includes/meta-boxes.php#L183) for adding this parameter.

A Custom Status is a Post Status you define.

Adding a custom status to WordPress is done via the [register\_post\_status()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_post_status) function. This function allows you to define the post status and how it operates within WordPress.

Hereâs a basic example of adding a custom post status called âUnreadâ:

```
function custom_post_status(){
	register_post_status( 'unread', array(
		'label'                     => _x( 'Unread', 'post' ),
		'public'                    => true,
		'exclude_from_search'       => false,
		'show_in_admin_all_list'    => true,
		'show_in_admin_status_list' => true,
		'label_count'               => _n_noop( 'Unread <span class="count">(%s)</span>', 'Unread <span class="count">(%s)</span>' ),
	) );
}
add_action( 'init', 'custom_post_status' );
```

# Introduction to Plugins <a name="documentation/article/introduction-to-plugins" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/introduction-to-plugins/

## Introduction

*Plugins are ways to extend and add to the functionality that already exists in WordPress*.

The core of WordPress is designed to be lean and lightweight, to maximize flexibility and minimize code bloat. Plugins offer custom functions and features so that each user can tailor their site to their specific needs.

For instructions and information on downloading, installing, upgrading, troubleshooting, and managing your WordPress Plugins, see [Managing Plugins](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins). If you want to develop your own plugin, there is a comprehensive list of resources in [Plugin Resources](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_Resources).

## Plugin Repositories

WordPress Plugins are available from several sources. The most popular and official source for WordPress Plugins is the WordPress.org repo.

- [Official WordPress Plugins Repository](#plugins)

Just to note, not all WordPress Plugins make it into the above repository. Search the web for âWordPress Pluginâ and the keywords for the type of functionality you are seeking. There is bound to be a solution out there for you.

## Default Plugins

The following two plugins are included with WordPress core: [Akismet](https://codex.wordpress.org/Akismet) checks your comments against the Akismet web service to see if they look like spam or not. You can review the spam it catches under âManageâ and it automatically deletes old spam after 15 days.

See all of the features in Akismet here: [\#pluginsakismet/](#pluginsakismet/)

**Hello Dolly** This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis Armstrong. Hello, Dolly. This is, by the way, the worldâs first official WordPress Plugin. When enabled you will randomly see a lyric from âHello, Dollyâ in the upper right of your [Administration Screens](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens) on every page.

## Changelog

- Updated 2023-07-05 
    - Removed developer jargon and old links to Codex

# Taxonomies <a name="documentation/article/taxonomies" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/taxonomies/

A taxonomy within WordPress is a way of grouping posts together based on a select number of relationships. By default, a standard post will have two taxonomy types called Categories and Tags which are a handy way of ensuring related content on your website is easy for visitors to find. These two types of taxonomies are included in WordPress by default, but just like any other taxonomy, can be removed or changed and you can even add more if you like.

## Taxonomies &amp; Terms

The relationship between taxonomies and terms is rather simple; think of taxonomies as the âparentâ and terms as the âchildrenâ. For example, a taxonomy called âRecipesâ for the âFoodâ post type could have multiple terms such as âVegetarianâ or âFreshâ, âEasy Cookingâ.

Another example is where you might have a post type called Reviews and a new post called âBest Films of The Yearâ. You can help define this content by having a taxonomy called âFilmsâ and create new terms such âTop Picksâ or âFilm Reviewsâ. All this does is help define your content into smaller chunks making it much easier to find and focus on.

## New Taxonomies &amp; Terms

As of WordPress version 2.3 you can create your own taxonomies for use on your website or blog with a small amount of code. You can also create an unlimited amount of terms if you wish which can be done within the dashboard user interface once the taxonomies have been created.

## Extending Taxonomies

Depending on whether your theme and plugins allow it, you can also extend the functionality of taxonomies and their terms to improve the categorisation of the content. This means that you can create taxonomy specific templates in your themes and also add new filtering options to look for posts in the dashboard too.

# FAQ Troubleshooting <a name="documentation/article/faq-troubleshooting" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-troubleshooting/

**Important:** Please note that this is not a support page. If you seek help with your specific problem, please refer to the [Support forums](#support/welcome).

Also refer [Common WordPress Errors](/support/article/common-wordpress-errors/) for the most common WordPress errors experienced by WordPress users such as

- The White Screen
- Internal Server Error
- Error Establishing Database Connection
- Failed Auto-Upgrade
- Connection Timed Out
- Maintenance Mode Following Upgrade
- PHP errors or MySQL DB errors

## How to deactivate all plugins when not able to access the administrative menus?

Sometimes it may be necessary to deactivate all plugins, but you canât access the Administration Screens to do so. One of two methods are available to deactivate all plugins.

Use [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/) to deactivate all plugins.

1. In the table wp\_options, under the *option\_name* column (field) find the *active\_plugins* row
2. Change the *option\_value* field to: **a:0:{}**

Or reset your plugins folder via [FTP](/support/article/ftp-clients/) or the file manager provided in your hostâs control panel. This method preserves plugin options but requires plugins be manually reactivated.

1. Via FTP or your hostâs file manager, navigate to the wp-contents folder (directory)
2. Via FTP or your hostâs file manager, rename the folder âpluginsâ to âplugins.holdâ
3. Login to your WordPress administration plugins page (/wp-admin/plugins.php) â this will disable any plugin that is âmissingâ.
4. Via FTP or your hostâs file manager, rename âplugins.holdâ back to âpluginsâ

## How to clear the âBriefly unavailable for scheduled maintenanceâ message after doing automatic upgrade?

As part of the automatic upgrade WordPress places a file named `.maintenance` in the blog **base** folder (folder that contains the wp-admin folder). If that file exists, then vistors will see the message **Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.**

To stop that message from being displayed to vistors, just delete the `.maintenance` file. The automatic upgrade should be executed again, just in case it failed.

## An update was just released, so why does my blog not recognize the update is available?

When an update is released, notification of that release is displayed at the top administration screens saying **WordPress x.x.x is available! Please update now.** Not every blog will see that message at the same time. Your blog is programmed to check for updates every 12 hours, but the timing of that check is purely random. So if your blog just checked for updates minutes before an update was released, you wonât see the update message until your blog checks for updates 12 hours later.

If you want your blog to check right now for updates, you can delete the **update\_core** option name record in your *wp\_options* table. Note that plugins and themes each have their own check and update cycle, controlled by the records **update\_plugins** and **update\_themes**, in *wp\_options*.

Relevant discussion thread:

- [\#support/topic/242485](#support/topic/242485)

## Why did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade?

A core upgrade copies all the new files from the distribution over the old ones, so if you changed existing files in the WordPress default theme (e.g. *wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/style.css*), those changes got overwritten with the new version of that file.

Please note, a core upgrade goes through a list of âold filesâ, as defined in *wp-admin/includes/update-core.php*, and deletes those files. Any files not on the list, and not in the distribution, are preserved.

**Remember, that before upgrades, whether automatic or manual, both the WordPress Files and database should be backed-up as explained in [WordPress Backups](/support/article/wordpress-backups/).**

A better way to modify the default theme is by using a [child theme](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Child Themes>). Itâs a little more work to set up, but worth the effort because your customizations will be safe when the main theme is updated.

## How do you repair a MySQL database table?

Every once in a while, it may be necessary to repair one or more MySQL database tables. According to the [How to Repair MyISAM Tables at dev.mysql.com](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/myisam-repair.html) there are a number of reasons to repair a table including errors such as âtbl\_name.frm is locked against changeâ, âCanât find file tbl\_name.MYI (Errcode: nnn)â, âUnexpected end of fileâ, âRecord file is crashedâ, or âGot error nnn from table handlerâ.

Here are the steps to repair a table in a MySQL database using [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/):

1. Login to hosting account.
2. Login to [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/).
3. Choose the affected database. If you only have one database, it should choose it by default so you donât need to do anything.
4. In the main panel, you should see a list of your database tables. Check the boxes by the tables that need repair.
5. At the bottom of the window just below the list of tables, there is a drop down menu. Choose âRepair Tableâ

Remember, that it is advisable to have a current backup of your database at all times. See also [WordPress Backups](/support/article/wordpress-backups/)

## How do I empty a database table?

Refer [Emptying a Database Table](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Emptying a Database Table>)

## Emailed passwords are not being received

**Description:** When users try to register with your blog or change their passwords by entering their username and/or email, WordPress indicates that their password has been emailed to them, but it is never received.

**Reason and Solutions:** WordPress uses the standard PHP mail() function, which uses sendmail. No account information is needed. This is not generally a problem if you are using a hosting service, but if you are using your own box and do not have an SMTP server, the mail will never send. If you are using a \*NIX box, you should have either postfix or sendmail on your machine; you will just need to set them up (search the Internet for how-toâs). If you do not want to go through setting up a complete mail server on your \*NIX box you may find msmtp useful â it provides *âA secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail hubâ*. On a Windows machine, try a sendmail emulator like [Glob SendMail](http://glob.com.au/sendmail/).

More help can be found on this thread of the WordPress Support Forums: [\#support/topic.php](#support/topic.php).

**Windows Host Server Specific:** Check your âRelayâ settings on the SMTP Virtual Server. Grant access to `127.0.0.1` . Then in your *php.ini*file, set the `SMTP` setting to the same IP address. Also set `smtp_port` to `25`.

**Ensure Proper Return Address is Used:** By default, the WordPress mailer fills in the From: field with *wordpress@yourdomain.com* and the From: name as *WordPress*.

This is fine if this is a valid e-mail address. For example, if your real e-mail is *wordpress@yourdomain.com*, your host should pass the email on for delivery. It will probably send your mail as long as *yourdomain.com* is setup to send and receive mail, even if *wordpress* is not a valid mail box. But if you set you real email as the From: address and itâs something like *wpgod@gmail.com*, the mail may not send because *gmail.com* is not a domain handled by the mail server.

**Treated as Spam:** Your email message may have been routed to a spam folder or even worse, simply discarded as malicious. There are a couple measures you can use to convince recipientâs mail servers that your message is legitimate and should be delivered as addressed.

**SPF:** (Sender Policy Framework) This is the most common anti-spam measure used. If you are on a hosted system, there is a good chance your host has set this up for the mail server you are using. Have WordPress email you and check the message headers for evidence that the message passed the SPF check. You can get a message sent by following the Forgot Password link on the login page. To keep your old password, do not follow the link in the message.  
If your system email failed the SPF check, you can set up the credentials if you have access to your DNS records and your mail serverâs domain belongs to you. Check the return path of the email your system sent. If the mail server listed there has your domain name, you can set up SPF credentials. There are several how-tos on the Internet.

**DKIM:** (Domain Key Identified Mail) This system is also used. You can use both SPF and DKIM in the same message. Again, just as with SPF, you can check if your receiving mailserver verified your hostâs domain key by examining the mail header. There is a fair chance no signature key was provided, indicating your host chose to not use this protocol. Also as with SPF, if you can edit your DNS records and the mail server belongs to your domain, you can set up DKIM credentials yourself. Some how-tos exist if you search the Internet.

## Why canât I see my posts? All I see is *Sorry, no posts match your criteria*?

Clearing your browser cache and cookies may resolve this problem. See also [I Make Changes and Nothing Happens](<https://codex.wordpress.org/I Make Changes and Nothing Happens>)

## How do I solve the *Headers already sent* warning problem?

**Description:** You got a warning message on your browser that says:

```
Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
(output started at
```

**Reason and Solution:**

It is usually because there are spaces, new lines, or other stuff before an opening `<?php` tag or after a closing `?>` tag, typically in **wp-config.php**. This can also happen in other edited PHP files that are not theme templates, so please check the error message, as it will list the specific file name where the error occurred (see âInterpreting the Error Messageâ below). Replacing the faulty file with one from your most recent backup or one from a fresh WordPress download is your best bet, but if neither of those are an option, please follow the steps below.

Just because you cannot see anything does not mean that PHP sees the same.

1. Download the file mentioned in the error message via [FTP](/support/article/ftp-clients/) or the file manager provided in your hostâs control panel.
2. Open that file in a [plain text editor](/support/article/glossary#text-editor) (**NOT** Microsoft Word or similar. Notepad or BBEdit are fine).
3. Check that the *very* first characters are with no blank lines or spaces after it.
4. Before saving, or use the Save as dialog, ensure the file encoding is not **`UTF-8 BOM`** but plain **`UTF-8`** or any without the **`BOM`** suffix.

To be sure about the end of the file, do this:

1. Place the cursor between the ? and &gt;
2. Now press the DELETE key on your computer **Note to MAC users**: The âDELETEâ key on a PC deletes characters to the *right* of the cursor. That is the key noted here.
3. Keep that key pressed
4. For at least 15 seconds
5. Now type &gt; and
6. **save** without pressing any other key at all.
7. If you press another key, you will bring the problem back.
8. DO **NOT** PUT CODE IN UNNECESSARY CODE BLOCKS, PUT THEM IN A SINGLE PHP BLOCK.

Wrong:

```
<?php some code; ?> <?php some other codes; ?> 
```

Correct:

```
<?php code; some other code; ?> 
```

Upload the file back to your server after editing and saving the file.

**Note**: Also check the encoding of the file. If the file is encoded as UTF-8 with BOM, the BOM is seen as a character which starts the output.

**Interpreting the Error Message:**

If the error message states: `Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/blog/wp-config.php:34) in /path/blog/wp-login.php on line 42`, then the problem is at line #34 of `wp-config.php`, not line #42 of `wp-login.php`. In this scenario, line #42 of `wp-login.php` is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #34 of `wp-config.php`.

If the error message states: `Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/wp-admin/admin-header.php:8) in /path/wp-admin/post.php on line 569`, then the problem is at line #8 of `admin-header.php`, not line #569 of `post.php`. In this scenario, line #569 of `post.php` is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #8 of `admin-header.php`.

## Why doesnât my âPublishâ or âSave Draftâ button work?

To resolve this and similar issues, disable your plugins one at a time until you find the source of the issue. Generally, this will be due to two or more plugins trying to use the same resources (for example, JQuery or other Java-based tools).

In addition, it could be that there is a problem with your browser. A common resolution is to empty the browserâs cache. Please consult the documentation for your preferred browser to learn how to do this.

## How to fix 404 error when using Pretty Permalinks?

If an error 404 occurs when using the [Pretty Permalink](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/#pretty-permalinks) choices such as **Day and Name** in [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#permalinks) &gt; [Settings\_Permalinks\_Screen](/support/article/settings-permalinks-screen/) it could be a result of the **mod\_rewrite** module not being activated/installed. The solution is to activate **mod\_rewrite** for the Apache web-server. Check the apache\\conf\\httpd.conf file for the line *\# LoadModule rewrite\_module modules/mod\_rewrite.so*  
and delete the # in front of the line. Then stop Apache and start it again. **Note:** you may have to ask your host to activate mod\_rewrite.

## Why isnât the admin user listed as an author when editing posts?

Not sure why this problem happens, but hereâs a couple of things to try one of these two solutions.

This usually fixes the problem:

1. Create new admin user (e.g. newadmin) with Administrator Role
2. Login as ânewadminâ
3. Degrade the old âadminâ user to Role of Subscriber and Save
4. Promote the old âadminâ back to Administrator Role and Save
5. Login as the old âadminâ

If that doesnât work, try:

1. Create a new admin user (e.g. newadmin) with Administrator Role
2. Login as ânewadminâ
3. Delete the old âadminâ user and assign any posts to ânewadminâ
4. Create âadminâ user with Administrator Role
5. Login as âadminâ
6. Delete ânewadminâ user and assign posts to âadminâ

## Why is the wrong author name displayed for a post on a blog?

This problem is usually solved by the same solution as is presented in the question right before this one:  
[Why isnât the admin user listed as an author when editing posts?](/support/article/faq-troubleshooting/#why-isnt-the-admin-user-listed-as-an-author-when-editing-posts)

# Pages screen <a name="documentation/article/pages-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pages-screen/

The Pages Screen provides the facility to manage all the [Pages](/support/article/pages/) in a blog. Via this Screen, Pages can be edited, deleted, and viewed. Filtering, and searching, also makes it easy to quickly find Pages matching certain criteria.

Several powerful features allow Pages to be edited in bulk (en masse) allowing fields such as Author, Parent, Template, Comments Allowed, Status, and Pings Allowed, to be changed for a whole batch of Pages. In addition, a Quick Edit feature provides an easy method to change a multitude of values, such as Title, Slug, Date, and Author, for a given Page.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/managepages-enV4.4.2.png)## Pages Screen

### Table of Pages

A table lists all of your Pages, by row. The Pages are listed with the newest Page first.

The table of Pages contains the following columns:

- **\[ \]** â This checkbox, when clicked (checked), âselectsâ that particular Page to be processed by a Bulk Action.
- **Title** â This is the Pageâs Title displayed as a link. Click the Title link to allow this Page to be edited in the Edit Page screen. Next to the Title, if a Page is of a Draft, Pending, or Password Protected nature, text will display showing that.
- **âIDâ** â This is not a column in the Table, but by hovering the mouse over the Page Title, the Page ID is revealed as part of the URL displayed in the browser status bar (in Firefox the status bar is displayed at the bottom of the screen). A Pageâs ID number is the unique number WordPressâ database uses to identify individual Pages.
- **Author** â Displayed in the form of a link, this is the [author](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Screen) who wrote the Page. Clicking the author link causes all the Pages authored by that user to be displayed in the Table of Pages (thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all Pages for a given author).
- **comment bubble** â A comment bubble is the column heading, and each Page row has comment bubble with the number of comments for that Page. If a Pages has any comments, then the number comments is displayed in a blue bubble. Clicking on a blue comment bubble causes the [Comments Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comments_Screen) to be displayed to allow moderation of those comments.
- **Date** â The Date column for each Page shows the Date âPublishedâ for Published Pages and the Date âLast Modifiedâ for other Pages.

#### Sortable Columns

Some column headings, such as the Title, Author, and Date, can be clicked to sort the Table of Pages in ascending or descending order. Hover over the column title, for example Title, to see the up-arrow or down-arrow. Click the heading to change the sort order.

#### Page Navigation

Under the Screen Options, the number of Pages displayed per page is determined. If more then one page of Pages is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided. Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward. Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display.

#### Screen Options

The [Screen Options](/support/article/administration-screens/#screen-options) allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. In addition, the number of Pages per page can be set. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.

#### Search

Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the âSearch Pagesâ button to search and display all the Pages meeting your search words.

### Filtering Options

At the top of this Screen are links such as All, Published, Pending Review, Draft, Private, that when clicked, will cause just the Pages of that type to be displayed in the underlying Table.

Below that, and to the right of the [Bulk Actions](#actions) [Apply button](#apply), are one other filter option:

**Show all dates**

This dropdown allows you to select, by date, which Pages are displayed in the [Table of Pages](#table-of-pages). By default, âShow all datesâ is selected and all of your Posts are displayed.

**Filter**

Clicking this button applies the settings you select in the dropdowns.

### Using Selection, Actions, and Apply

#### Selection

This Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more Pages selected in the Table. For Bulk Actions to be performed on multiple Pages at once, those Pages must be first **selected** via one of these methods:

- **Select one Page at a time** â To select a Page, the checkbox to the left of the Page entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Pages by checking their respective checkbox.

#### Actions

Actions describe the process to be performed on particular Pages. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as *Bulk Actions* and *Immediate Actions*. The following describes these Actions:

- **Bulk Actions** â These Actions can be performed on one, or more Pages, at one time, if those Pages have been previously [selected](/support/article/pages-screen/#Selection). Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk Actions pulldown box, above the Table. The only Bulk Actions allowed are Edit and Delete.

The available Actions are described below:

- **Edit** â This Action can be either an âImmediate Actionâ or a âBulk Actionâ. The Immediate Action, initiated by click on the Title or clicking on the Edit option just below the Title, causes the Edit Pages screen to display. Edit is also available as a Bulk Action for the selected Pages, so see the Bulk Edit section for details on the Bulk Editing process.

##### Bulk Edit

The Bulk Edit Pages âscreenâ is displayed below the Table Of Pages header once, one, or more, Pages have been [selected](#selection), and the [Bulk Action](#action) of Edit is [Applied](/support/article/pages-screen/#Apply). Bulk Edit allows the fields Author, Parent, Template, Comments Allowed, Status, and Pings Allowed, to be changed for all the selected Pages.

- **Cancel** â Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Bulk Edit of these Pages.

##### Quick Edit

Quick Edit is an Immediate Action performed on one Page by clicking the Quick Edit link under the Page Title in the Table of Pages. Quick Edit is just an in-line edit that allows you to change the following itemsâTitle, Slug, Date, Author, Password or Private page box, Parent, Order, Template, Allow Comments, Allow Pings, Status.

- **Cancel** â Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Edit of this Page.

##### Editing Individual Pages

This mode is essentially the same as the [Pages Add New Screen](/support/article/pages-add-new-screen/) so see that Screen for the specific details of writing a Page. The only difference is that the button to save your work is called â**Update**â instead of â**Publish**â.

#### Apply

After one or more Pages are *selected*, and after a *Bulk* Action is specified, the **Apply** button performs the given Action on the selected Pages.

- **Apply** â Click the Apply button to execute the Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pulldown, on the selected Pages. Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Pages must be **selected**, as described before.

# Create a Favicon <a name="documentation/article/create-a-favicon" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-favicon/

A *favicon* (short for âfavorite iconâ) is an icon associated with a particular website or web page. It is generally intended to be used when you bookmark a web page. Web browsers use them in the URL bar, on tabs, and elsewhere to help identify a website visually. Favicons are also used as application icons on mobile devices.

## WordPress Version 6.5 or later

WordPress [Version 6.5](#documentation/wordpress-version/version-6-5) moved the site icon to **General Settings**.

Follow the steps below to set **Site Icon** from General settings.

1. Prepare the image file and upload to media library. (It must be square, having a height and width of at least 512 px. and a .png is the recommended format)
2. Navigate to [General Settings](#documentation/article/settings-general-screen)
3. Click Choose a Site icon.
4. Select image file that you prepared in the previous step.

![screenshot of the general settings tab where the site icon is added in WordPress since version 6.5](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/6-5-favicon-general-settings.png)## WordPress Version 4.3 to 6.4

WordPress [Version 4.3](#documentation/wordpress-version/version-4-3) implemented a Site Icon feature that enables favicons on your web site.

When you use the Site Icon feature, you donât need to prepare the `favicon.ico` file by yourself, or modify your template file. All you have to do is navigate to the Customize screen and specify a square image that has a height and width of at least 512 px.

Later paragraphs in this article contain instructions for manually setting up your own favicon. However, it is highly recommended that you use the Site Icon feature (a feature that is built-in to WordPress) instead.

Follow the steps below to use Site Icon to set up a favicon for your site.

1. Prepare the image file. (It must be square, having a height and width of at least 512 px.)
2. Navigate to [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; Appearance &gt; Customize
3. Click **Site Identity**
4. Click **Select Image** (located under the **Site Icon** subheading).
5. Click on the **Upload Files** tab, then click **Select Files** to upload the image file that you prepared in the previous step.

# Create a static front page <a name="documentation/article/create-a-static-front-page" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-static-front-page/

***Goal**: you will know what a Static Front page is, and you will be able to set up a Static Front Page on your WordPress site.*

***Pre-requisites**: you need to know the difference between [Pages](/support/article/pages/) and Post*.

## What is a Static Front Page

By default, WordPress displays a list of *Posts* on the home page of your site. This list of posts is *automatically updated* as soon as new posts are published, thus this is not static. Also, there is no need to create any page in order to have WordPress displaying this list of posts.

A Static Front Page is **a specific Page** used as *the Home Page* of the site.

## How to create a Static Front Page

*Reminder: to create a page, go to **Pages &gt; Add New***

![How to create a Static Front Page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-23-at-2.04.35-PM-1024x327.png)1. **Home Page**: (if not already created) create **the Page you want to use** as the Static Front (Home) Page.
2. **Posts Page**: (if not already created) create an **empty page**. Give it **a title** that will be used on top of your posts list. **This step is mandatory** as you are modifying WordPress default setting. *Any other content other than Title will not be displayed* at all on this specific page.
3. **Setting**: go to **Settings &gt; Reading**, then âHome page displaysâ. 
    1. Static Page setting: **select a static page** (instead of the default *Your latest posts*).
    2. Home Page setting: in âHome pageâ list, **select the page you want** for Static Front(Home) Page.
    3. Posts Page setting: in âPosts pageâ list, **select the empty page** you created. *Do not select any page with content*, as it will not be displayed.
4. **Save your settings** by clicking âSave Changesâ button.

Connect to your site home page: you should now see the Page you selected.

# Use Gravatars <a name="documentation/article/use-gravatars" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-gravatars/

## What is a Gravatar?

When browsing different web sites, you may notice that many users have a picture next to their name. These pictures are called âavatars.â WordPress, however, uses a specific type of avatar called â[Gravatars](https://en.gravatar.com/)ââshort for âGlobally Recognized Avatar.â Unlike standard avatars, Gravatars follow you around the web and automatically appear when you post a comment on a WordPress site.

https://videopress.com/v/HNyK67JS 

A short introduction video presenting Gravatar[![gravatar_example](#documentation/files/2018/11/gravatar_example.png)](#documentation/files/2018/11/gravatar_example.png)WordPress integrates Gravatars into every WordPress site. Once [registered with Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/site/signup/), the service matches your WordPress profile information to the email address registered with Gravatar and displays your custom Gravatar image next to comments and (optionally) elsewhere on the WordPress site. If you choose not to sign up with Gravatar, the [ default icon set by the Administrator](#using-gravatars-on-your-site) appears next to your name.

## Why use Gravatars?

Providing your users with avatars has become a convention in web-publishing. Enabling Gravatars on your WordPress site simplifies the process for everyone involved. While it is possible to use a [WordPress Plugin](#plugins) to manage user avatars on your WordPress-run site, using Gravatars on your site makes less work for both you and your siteâs users.

### Benefits for Administrators

- You can add user Gravatars with very little effort
- You donât need to maintain an additional Plugin
- You donât have to manage user accounts, or their images, for commenters to use Gravatars on your site

### Benefits for Users

- You donât need to register for every site you visit just to use a Gravatar
- You can update the Gravatar you use across multiple sites by uploading a single image in a single place

## Using Gravatars on your Site

To [start using Gravatars](https://en.gravatar.com/site/signup) on your site:

1. Log in as an administrator to your site
2. Navigate to [ Settings](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) &gt;[ Discussion](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) and scroll down to the âAvatarâ Section
3. The âAvatarâ section presents you with several options:
    - **Avatar Display**: Toggle Gravatars on and off for your site.
    - **Maximum Rating**: When users create a profile on Gravatar, they are given the opportunity to rate their Gravatar image as G, PG, R, X based on its appropriateness. Select the radio button for the maximum rating you would like displayed on your site.
    - **Default Avatar**: WordPress allows for you to select what image you would like to display when a commenter does not have a Gravatar account. Selecting one of the âgeneratedâ icons give you and your users some of the benefits of a Gravatar without requiring them to [have a Gravatar account](https://en.gravatar.com/site/signup). The icons that say âgeneratedâ next to them take the email of the commenter and link it to an auto-generated image. Now, every time that commenter posts to your site, they will have the same unique image next to their name.

[![Avatar rating and default icon](#documentation/files/2018/11/avatar_rating_default.png)](#documentation/files/2018/11/avatar_rating_default.png)### Using Gravatarâs Hovercards

If you want to use Gravatarâs Hovercard feature, like on WordPress.com, you can install the [Jetpack](https://jetpack.me/) Plugin.

# Settings Writing screen <a name="documentation/article/settings-writing-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-writing-screen/

Use the Settings Writing Screen to control the interface you use when writing new posts. These settings control WordPressâs features in the adding and editing posts, Pages, and [Post Types](/support/article/post-types/), as well as the optional functions like Remote Publishing, Post via e-mail, and Update Services.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/02/settings-writing-4_9_4-1024x797.jpg)### Writing Settings

**Default Post Category**  
The [Category](/support/article/glossary#category) you select from this drop-down is called the default post Category. The default post Category is Category assigned to a post if you fail to assign any other Categories with writing your posts. If you delete a Category, the posts in that Category will be assigned the default post Category. If you have several Categories, but use one of those Categories more frequently, select that Category here to make your life a little easier.

**Default Post Format**  
The Post Format you select from this drop-down is called the default Post Format. Post Formats are used by themes to create different styling for different types of posts. This settings is only visible if the current activated theme supports Post Formats. The WordPress default theme is an example of a theme that supports various Post Formats including Standard (no special format), Aside, and Gallery.

### Post via e-mail

With this option, you can set up your blog to publish e-mails as blog posts. To do this, you would send an e-mail to a specific address youâve established for the purpose. More than likely, you will need the help of your web host and/or your e-mail provider.

This messages is displayed at the beginning of this section: âTo post to WordPress by e-mail you must set up a secret e-mail account with POP3 access. Any mail received at this address will be posted, so itâs a good idea to keep this address very secret. Here are three random strings you could use: *FKZXx8EK*, *P6snQ5Lq*, *YcrfBw03*.â

Complete the following fields to post by e-mail:

**Mail Server**  
A mail server receives e-mails on your behalf and stores them for retrieval. Your mail server will have a URI address, such as mail.example.com, which you should enter here.

**Port**  
Servers usually use port 110 to receive requests related to emails. If your mail server uses a different port, enter that port number here.

**Login Name**  
If, for example, the e-mail address that you will be using for the writing by e-mail feature is wordpress@example.com, then âwordpressâ is the **Login name**.

**Password**  
Enter the password for the above e-mail address here. Three possible passwords are displayed by WordPress in the introduction section of this Screen.

**Default Mail Category**  
WordPress will assign this [Category](/support/article/glossary#category) to all of the posts published via the Post by e-mail feature. Note: You can create new Categories in [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content) &gt; [Categories](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_Screen).

### Update Services

When you publish a new post, WordPress automatically notifies the update services of the sites listed in the box. For more about this, see [Update Services](/support/article/update-services/) on the Codex. When entering services, separate multiple URIs with line breaks.

### Save Changes

Click the **Save Changes** button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.

# Settings Reading screen <a name="documentation/article/settings-reading-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-reading-screen/

The options in the **Reading **Settings**** **Screen** are few in number, but still important. You can decide if you want your latest [posts](/support/article/writing-posts/) or a âstaticâ [P](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages)[a](/support/article/pages)[ge](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages) displayed as your websiteâs front (home) page. You can also adjust how many posts are displayed on that home page. In addition, you can adjust [syndication feed](/support/article/glossary#feed) features to determine how the information from your site is sent to a readerâs web browser or other applications.

## Reading Settings

 Your websiteâs front page uses these settings to determine if your posts or a âstaticâ [Page](/support/article/pages) is displayed as your websiteâs home (main) page. These settings work only if you have one or more [Pages](/support/article/pages) defined. Please note: static front page plugins and other âposts displayâ control/restriction plugins may affect how these features work!

![Reading Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/options-reading.png)Reading Settings

- **Your latest posts** â Check this radio button so your latest posts are displayed on the blogâs home page. Remember, the number of posts you display is controlled by the âBlog pages show at mostâ setting.
- **A static page (select below)** â Check this radio button to have a âstaticâ [Page](/support/article/pages) be displayed as your blogâs home page. At the same time, choose the Page that will display your actual Posts. The Home page and Posts page cannot be the same.

- **Home page** â In the drop-down box, select the actual [Page](/support/article/pages) that you want displayed as your front page. If you do not select a choice here, then effectively your blog will show your posts on both the blogâs front page and on the **Posts page** you specify. If you would like to create a static home page template file, **do not** name it home.php, otherwise you will encounter problems when you try to view the âblogâ/âpostsâ section of your site. To get around this, just name it anything but home.php, for example, myhome.php
- **Posts page** â In the drop-down box, select the name of the [Page](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pages) that will now contain your Posts. If you do not select a Page here, your Posts will only be accessible via other navigation features such as category, calendar, or archive links. Even if the selected Page is password protected, visitors will NOT be prompted for a password when viewing the Posts Page. Also, any Template assigned to the Page will be ignored and the themeâs *index.php* (or *home.php* if it exists) will control the display of the posts.

 See [Creating a Static Front Page](/support/article/creating-a-static-front-page/) for more detail.

 **Blog pages show at most**

- **\[X\] posts** â Enter the number of posts to be displayed, per page, on your site.

 **Syndication feeds show the most recent**

- **\[X\] posts** â Enter the number of posts people will see when they download one of your siteâs feeds.

**For each article in a feed, show**

Determines whether or not the feed will include the full article or just an excerpt.

- **Full text** â Click this radio button to include the full content of each post.
- **Excerpt** â Click this radio button to include an excerpt of the post. This could save bandwidth.

**Encoding for pages and feeds *(Removed as of [Version 3.5.0](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5))***

Enter the character encoding to set the choice of languages in which you, the other authors, and your commenters, can write. The default (and safe choice) is âUTF-8â (see [Unicode](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Unicode)), as that encoding supports a wide variety of languages. If you wish to use some other character encoding (for example you have imported or will import articles written using a different character encoding) then specify that here. Caution should be used when changing this field as it may change the way information is displayed on your blog. For a more in-depth article on character encoding see [Wikipedia:Character encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding).

**Search Engine Visibility *(New as of [Version 3.5.0](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5))***

 Note: the Settings â Privacy screen has been removed from WordPress as of [Version 3.5.0](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5)).

Check the *Discourage search engines from indexing this site* box to ask search engines not to index this site. When the option is checked, the following happens:

- (Since [Version 5.3](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/02/changes-to-prevent-search-engines-indexing-sites/)) Causes â&lt;meta name=ârobotsâ content=ânoindex,nofollowâ /&gt;â to be generated into the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; section (if wp\_head is used) of your siteâs source, causing search engine spiders to ignore your site.
- (Till Version 5.2) Causes hits to robots.txt to send back:

```
User-agent: *<br></br>Disallow: /
```

**Note:** The above only works if WordPress is installed in the site root and no robots.txt exists.

- Stops pings to ping-o-matic and any other RPC ping services specified in the [Update Services](/support/article/settings-writing-screen/#update-services) of [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#writing) &gt;[Writing](/support/article/settings-writing-screen/). This works by having the function privacy\_ping\_filter() remove the sites to ping from the list. This filter is added by having add\_filter(âoption\_ping\_sitesâ,âprivacy\_ping\_filterâ); in the default-filters. When the generic\_pingfunction attempts to get the âping\_sitesâ option, this filter blocks it from returning anything.

- Hides the [Update Services](/support/article/settings-writing-screen/#update-services) option entirely on the [Administration](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#writing) &gt; [Writing](/support/article/settings-writing-screen/) screen with the message âWordPress is not notifying any Update Services because of your blogâs privacy settings.â

- Allows normal visitors.

 \*Note: *Neither of these options blocks access to your site â it is up to search engines to honor your request.*

### Save Changes

 Click the **Save Changes** button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.

# Settings General screen <a name="documentation/article/settings-general-screen" />

This Settings General Screen is the default Screen in the [Settings Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) and controls some of the most basic configuration settings for your site: your siteâs title and location, who may register an account at your site, and how dates and times are calculated and displayed.

[![](#documentation/files/2018/11/760px-options-general.png)](#documentation/files/2018/11/760px-options-general.png)## General Settings

### **Site title**

Enter the name of your site (or blog) here. Most themes will display this title, at the top of every page, and in the readerâs browser titlebar. WordPress also uses this title as the identifying name for your [Syndication](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/#syndication) feeds.

### **Tagline**

In a few words, explain what your site is about. Your sitesâ slogan, or tagline, might be entered here. A tagline is short phrase, or sentence, used to convey the essence of the site and is often funny or eye-catching. The default tagline is an empty string.

### **WordPress Address (URL)**

Enter the full URL of the directory containing your WordPress core application files (e.g., wp-config.php, wp-admin, wp-content, and wp-includes). For example, if you installed WordPress into a directory called âblogâ, then the WordPress address would be `http://example.net/blog` (where example.net is your domain). If you installed WordPress into your web root, this address will be the root URL `http://example.net`. WordPress will trim a slash (`/`) from the end. If you defined the **WP\_SITEURL** constant in your [`wp-config.php`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#WordPress_address_.28URL.29) file, that value will appear in this field and you will not be able to make changes to it from the WordPress administration screen.

### **Site Address (URL)**

Enter the address you want people to type in their browser to reach your WordPress site. This is the directory where WordPressâs main `index.php` file is installed. The *Site address (URL)* is identical to the *WordPress address (URL)* (above) unless you are [giving WordPress its own directory](/support/article/giving-wordpress-its-own-directory/). WordPress will trim a slash (`/`) from the end. If you defined the **WP\_HOME** constant in your [`wp-config.php`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Blog_address_.28URL.29) file, that value will appear in this field and you will not be able to make changes to it from the WordPress administration screen.

### **E-mail Address**

Enter the e-mail address to which you want WordPress to send messages regarding the administration and maintenance of your WordPress site. For example, if you allow new users to register as a member of your site (see Membership below), then a notification will be sent through e-mail to this address. In addition, if the option, **An administrator must always approve the comment**, is set in [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#discussion) &gt; [Discussion](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/), this e-mail address will receive notification that the comment is being held for moderation. Please note this is different than the address you supplied for the **admin** user account; the **admin** account e-mail address is sent an e-mail only when someone submits a comment to a post by **admin**. The address you enter here will never be displayed on the site. You can send messages to multiple admins by using an email address which forwards email to multiple recipients.

### **Membership**

**Anyone can register** â Check this checkbox if you want anyone to be able to register an account on your site.

### **New User Default Role**

This drop-down box allows you to select the default [Role](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/) that is assigned to new users. This Default [Role](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/) will be assigned to newly registered members or users added via the [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Users ](/support/article/administration-screens/#users-your-blogging-family) &gt; [Users Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Screen). Valid choices are [Administrator](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator), [Editor](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#editor), [Author](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#author), [Contributor](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#contributor), or [Subscriber](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#subscriber).

### **Site Language**

The WordPress dashboard language.

### **Timezone** 

From the drop-down box, choose a city in the same timezone as you. For example, under America, select New York if you reside in the Eastern Timezone of the United States that honors daylight savings times. If you canât identify a city in your timezone, select one of the **Etc GMT** settings that represents the number of hours by which your time differs from [Greenwich Mean Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time). Click the **Save Changes** button and the [UTC time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) and âLocal timeâ will display to confirm the correct Timezone was selected.

### **Date Format**

The format in which to display dates on your site. The Date Format setting is intended to be used by theme designers in displaying dates on your site, but does not control how the date is displayed in the Administrative Screens (e.g. Manage Posts). Click the **Save Changes** button and the âOutputâ example below will show the current date in the format entered. See [Formatting Date and Time](/support/article/formatting-date-and-time/) for some of the formats available.

### **Time Format**

The format in which to display times on your site. The Time Format setting is intended to be used by theme designers in displaying time on your site, but does not control how the time is displayed in the Administrative Screens (e.g. Write Post edit of timestamp). Click the **Save Changes** button and the âOutputâ example below will show the current time in the format entered. See [Formatting Date and Time](/support/article/formatting-date-and-time/) for some of the formats available.

### **Week Starts On**

Select your preferred start date for WordPress calendars from the drop-down box. Monday is the default setting for this drop-down, meaning a monthly calendar will show Monday in the first column. If you want your calendar to show Sunday as the first column, then select Sunday from the drop-down.

### Save Changes

Click the **Save Changes** button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.

# Pages Add New screen <a name="documentation/article/pages-add-new-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/pages-add-new-screen/

The Pages Add New Screen allows you to add new [Pages](/support/article/pages/).

![Add a New Page Screeen](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/writepage.png)## Screen options

The [Screen Options](/support/article/administration-screens#screen-options) allow you to choose which modules are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying screen. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a checkbox next to each column. Check the box for each module you want displayed, or uncheck the box to not display that module. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options. These options are saved so that you can customize how your own editing screen looks. So if modules such as Custom Fields, Discussion, Slug and Post Author are hidden from view use the Screen Options to expose those modules.

## Expanding, collapsing, and rearranging, modules

The modules, Publish, Page Attribute, Features Image and others, can be expanded, or collapsed, by clicking on the module title bar.

In addition, those modules can be moved by hovering the mouse cursor over the module title bar, when the mouse cursor changes to 4-arrows, hold the left-mouse button down, drag the module to where you want to place it, then release the mouse button (this is called drag-and-drop).

## Add new page

**Title**

The title of your page. You can use any words or phrases. Avoid using the same title twice as that will cause problems. You can use commas, apostrophes, quotes, hypens/dashes, and other typical symbols in the page like âAbout My Site â Hereâs Lookinâ at You, Kid.â WordPress will clean it up for the link to the page, called the *slug*.

**Page editing area**

The blank box where you enter your writing, links, links to images, and any information you want to display on your site. You can use either the Visual or the Text view to compose your posts. For more on the Text view, see the [Visual ](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing Posts#Visual_Versus Text_Editor>)[Versus](/support/article/writing-posts/#visual-versus-text-editor)[ Text View](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing Posts#Visual_Versus Text_Editor>) article.

**Preview button**

Allows you to view the page before officially publishing it.

**Publish box**

Contains buttons that control the state of your page. The main states are Published, Pending Review, and Draft. A *Published* status means the page has been published on your blog for all to see. *Pending Review* means the draft is waiting for review by an editor prior to publication. *Draft* means the page has not been published and remains a draft for you. If you select a specific publish status and click the update page or Publish button, that status is applied to the page. For example, to save a page in the *Pending Review* status, click Edit link of Status and select Pending Review from the drop-down box, click OK to close the drop-down box and click Save As Pending button. (You will see all pages organized by status by going to Pages &gt; All Pages). To schedule a page for publication on a future time or date, click âEditâ in the Publish area next to the words âPublish immediatelyâ. You can also change the publish date to a date in the past to back-date pages. Change the settings to the desired time and date. You must also hit the âPublishâ button when you have completed the page to publish at the desired time and date.

Visibility â This determines how your page appears to the world. Public pages will be visible by all website visitors once published. Password Protected pages are published to all, but visitors must know the password to view the page content. Private pages are visible only to you (and to other editors or admins within your site)

**Permalink**

After you save your page, the Permalink below the title shows the potential URL for the page, as long as you have [permalinks](/support/article/using-permalinks/) enabled. (To enable permalinks, go to Settings &gt; Permalinks.) The URL is generated from your title. In previous versions of WordPress, this was referred to as the âpage-slug.â The commas, quotes, apostrophes, and other non-HTML favorable characters are changed and a dash is put between each word. If your title is âMy Site â Hereâs Lookinâ at You, Kidâ, it will be cleaned up to be âmy-site-heres-lookin-at-you-kidâ as the title. You can manually change this, maybe shortening it to âmy-site-lookin-at-you-kidâ.

**Save**

Allows you to save your page as a draft / pending review rather than immediately publishing it. To return to your drafts later, visit Pages &gt; All Pages from dashboard, then click your page title from the list.

**Publish**

Publishes your page on the site. You can edit the time when the page is published by clicking the Edit link above the Publish button and specifying the time you want the page to be published. By default, at the time the page is first auto-saved, that will be the date and time of the page within the database.

**Parent**

Parent page controls how deep your page hierarchy goes.

**Template**

Some Themes have custom templates you can use for certain pages that might have additional features or custom layouts. If so, youâll see them in this dropdown menu.

**Order**

Page order to sort the list of Pages.

# Reset your password <a name="documentation/article/reset-your-password" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reset-your-password/

In WordPress, there is more than one way to reset your password. (Normally, the easiest way to reset it is through the âLost your password?â link on the main login page for your blog or website.)  
However, there are certain times (especially if your email isnât working correctly) that you may have to take different steps to reset your password.

Hereâs a list of different ways to reset a password. The method that you use depends on the type of access that you still have to your website.

## To Change Your Password

To change your password in current versions:

1. In the Administration Screen, menu, go to Users &gt; All Users.
2. Click on your username in the list to edit it.
3. In the Edit User screen, scroll down to the New Password section and click the Generate Password button.
4. If you want to change the automatically generated password, you can overwrite it by typing a new password in the box provided. The strength box will show you how good (strong) your password is.
5. Click the Update User button.

 Your new password becomes active immediately.

## Through the automatic emailer

If you know your username or the email account in your profile, you can use the âlost passwordâ feature of WordPress.

- Go to your WordPress Login page (something like [http://yoursite.com/wordpress/wp-login.php](https://codex.wordpress.org/Resetting_your_password))
- Click on the âLost your password?â link
- You will be taken to a page to enter some details. Enter your username or the email address on file for that account.
- Wait happily as your new password is emailed to you.
- Once you get your new password, login to your profile page and change this password to something you can *remember*.

## Through MySQL Command Line

1. Get an MD5 hash of your password. 
    - [Visit md5 Hash Generator](http://www.miraclesalad.com/webtools/md5.php), orâ¦
    - Create a key with Python, orâ¦
    - On Unix/Linux: 
        1. Create a file called wp.txt, containing nothing but the new password.
        2. tr -d â\\r\\nâ &lt; wp.txt | md5sum | tr -d â -â
        3. rm wp.txt
    - On Mac OS X: 
        1. Create a file called wp.txt, containing nothing but the new password. Then enter either of the lines below
        2. md5 -q ./wp.txt; rm ./wp.txt (If you want the MD5 hash printed out.)
        3. md5 -q ./wp.txt | pbcopy; rm ./wp.txt (If you want the MD5 hash copied to the clipboard.)
2. âmysql -u root -pâ (log in to MySQL)
3. enter your mysql password
4. âuse (name-of-database)â (select WordPress database)
5. âshow tables;â (youâre looking for a table name with âusersâ at the end)
6. âSELECT ID, user\_login, user\_pass FROM (name-of-table-you-found);â (this gives you an idea of whatâs going on inside)
7. âUPDATE (name-of-table-you-found) SET user\_pass=â(MD5-string-you-made)â WHERE ID = (id#-of-account-you-are-reseting-password-for);â (actually changes the password)
8. âSELECT ID, user\_login, user\_pass FROM (name-of-table-you-found);â (confirm that it was changed)
9. (type Control-D to exit mysql client)

Note: if you have a recent version of MySQL (version 5.x?) you can have MySQL compute the MD5 hash for you.

1. Skip step# 1 above.
2. Do the following for step# 7 instead. 
    - âUPDATE (name-of-table-you-found) SET user\_pass = MD5(â(new-password)â) WHERE ID = (id#-of-account-you-are-reseting-password-for);â (actually changes the password)

Note that even if the passwords are salted, meaning they look like $P$BLDJMdyBwegaCLE0GeDiGtC/mqXLzB0, you can still replace the password with an MD5 hash, and WordPress will let you log in.

## Through phpMyAdmin

This article is for those who have [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/) access to their database. **Note: use phpMyAdmin at your own risk. If you doubt your ability to use it, seek further advice. WordPress is not responsible for loss of data.**

1. Begin by logging into phpMyAdmin and clicking **databases**.
2. A list of databases will appear. Click on your WordPress database.

[![PHPMyAdmin database selection](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw2.jpg?fit=355%2C316&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw2.jpg?fit=355%2C316&ssl=1)phpMyAdmin database select3. All the tables in your database will appear. If not, click **Structure**.
4. Look for **wp\_users** in the Table column.
5. Click on the icon for **browse**.
6. Locate your username under user\_login
7. Click **edit** (may look like a pencil icon in some versions of phpMyAdmin).

[![PHPMyAdmin select users database table](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw3.jpg?fit=343%2C226&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw3.jpg?fit=343%2C226&ssl=1)phpMyAdmin select users table8. Your user\_id will be shown. Click on Edit.
9. Next to the user\_pass is a long list of numbers and letters.
10. Select and delete these and type in your new password.
11. Type in the password you want to use. You can type it in normallyâbut remember, it is case-sensitive.
12. In this example, the new password will be ârabbitseatcarrots.â
13. Once you have done that, click the dropdown menu indicated, and select MD5 from the menu.

[![phpMyAdmin select MD5 function on user_pass row](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw6.jpg?fit=415%2C139&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw6.jpg?fit=415%2C139&ssl=1)phpMyAdmin select MD5 function on user\_pass row14. Check that your password is actually correct, and that MD5 is in the box.

[![phpMyAdmin user_pass row with MD5 function and "rabbitseatcarrots" as the password](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw7.jpg?fit=415%2C76&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/changepw7.jpg?fit=415%2C76&ssl=1)phpMyAdmin user\_pass row with MD5 function and ârabbitseatcarrotsâ as the password15. Click the âGoâ button to the bottom right.
16. Test the new password on the login screen. If it doesnât work, check that youâve followed these instructions exactly.

### Other Tutorials using phpMyAdmin

- [Reset a WordPress password from phpMyAdmin](http://www.devlounge.net/articles/reset-a-wordpress-password-from-phpmyadmin)

## Through FTP

There is also an easy way to reset your password via FTP, if youâre using the admin user.

1. Login to your site via FTP and download your active themeâs functions.php file.
2. Edit the file and add this code to it, right at the beginning, after the first `<?php`  
      
    `wp_set_password( 'my_new_password', 1 );`  
      
    In the above code, replace the text `my_new_password` with your own new password for the main admin user. The number `1` above refers to the user ID number in the `wp_users` database table. Since we wanted the user ID of the main admin user, we just keep the number as `1`, which is typically the user ID of the main admin user.
3. Upload the modified file back to your site.
4. Once you are able to login, make sure to go back and remove that code. It will reset your password on every page load until you do so.

## Through WP CLI

WP CLI is a command line tool for managing your WordPress installation.

1. Move into the /wordpress directory and type  
      
    `$ wp user list<br></br>`  
    to see all users. Find the ID of the user youâd like to update.

2. Then, update the user  
      
    `$ wp user update 1 --user_pass=$UP3RstrongP4$w0rd<br></br>`  
    replacing â1â with the id of the user you want to update.

[More on wp cli](http://wp-cli.org/)

## Using the Emergency Password Reset Script

If the other solutions listed above wonât work, then try the Emergency Password Reset Script. Please note that itâs not a plugin, itâs a PHP script.

### A Word of Caution:

1. The Emergency Password Reset Script requires that you know the administratorâs username.
2. It updates the administrator password and sends an email to the administratorâs email address.
3. Even if you donât receive the email, the password will still be changed.
4. You do not need to be logged in to use it. (After all, if you could login, you wouldnât need the script.)
5. Place the script in the root of your WordPress installation. Do not upload it to your WordPress Plugins directory.
6. For security reasons, remember to delete the script when you are done.

### Directions for Use:

1. Copy the emergency script from [Emergency Password Script](https://codex.wordpress.org/User:MichaelH/Orphaned_Plugins_needing_Adoption/Emergency) and put into a file called emergency.php in the root of your WordPress installation (the same directory that contains wp-config.php).
2. In your browser, open http://example.com/emergency.php.
3. As instructed, enter the administrator username (usually admin) and the new password, then click **Update Options**. A message is displayed noting the changed password. An email is sent to the blog administrator with the changed password information.
4. **Delete emergency.php from your server when you are done.** Do not leave it on your server, as someone else could use it to change your password.

## Additional Reference

- Here is another [password reset script](http://kuttler.eu/code/wordpress-password-reset/) that can be used without knowing the username or email.

# Settings Discussion screen <a name="documentation/article/settings-discussion-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-discussion-screen/

The **Settings Discussion Screen** allows you to set the options concerning comments (also called discussion). It is here the administrator decides if [comments](/support/article/glossary/#comments) are allowed, if [pingbacks](/support/article/glossary/#pingback) and [trackbacks](/support/article/glossary/#trackback) are acceptable, and what constitutes [Comment Spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam). On this Screen you also control the circumstances under which your blog sends you e-mail notification of certain events at your site.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/320px-options-discussion1.png)

## Discussion Settings

### Default article Setting

These settings may be overridden for individual articles.

- **Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article** â If you check this box, WordPress will send out a ping to a site or article you have linked to in your post. Your mention of their site or article will show up in the comment section of their site, if that site allows [pingbacks](/support/article/glossary/#pingback). The notification occurs during the process of publishing your article to the internet. An article with many hyperlinks will slow the posting process as WordPress contacts all of the sites before the post is published.
- **Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks)** â Check this box so WordPress to accepts or declines the pings from other sites which may reference your site or an article on your site. If this box is checked, [pingbacks](/support/article/glossary/#pingback) and [trackbacks](/support/article/glossary/#trackback) will appear in the comments section of your posts.
- **Allow people to post comments on new articles** â Check this box if you wish to allow comments to your posts. Remember that this can be overridden for individual articles. Comments can also be controlled by making an article PRIVATE, which requires the appropriate password before a comment is allowed. If you donât wish to allow comments uncheck this setting.

### Other comment settings

- **Comment author must fill out name and e-mail** â Check this box as a way to force spammers to do a bit of extra work. In reality, the name and e-mail address are not verified in any way prior to the comment being submitted. Most legitimate commenters are more than willing to fill out a name and e-mail address.
- **Users must be registered and logged in to comment** â If this checkbox is checked, only logged in *registered users* will be able to write comments on your site.
- **Automatically close comments on articles older than \[X\] days** â Check the box and enter the number of days (e.g. 14 days) after which WordPress will automatically flag eligible posts so that no more comments are accepted.
- **Enable threaded (nested) comments \[X\] levels deep** â Check this box to enable threaded comments, then from the drop-down box, select the number of levels deep (maximum of 10 levels) you will allow for nested comments. Note that themes need to be specially coded to properly display threaded comments.
- **Break comments into pages with \[X\] top level comments per page and the \[last/first\] page displayed by default. Comments should be displayed with the \[older/newer\] comments at the top of each page** â Check this box to cause comments to display in a paginated format with the specified number of comments per page. In addition, specify if the pages should be ordered âfirst to lastâ or âlast to firstâ, and within each page, whether the oldest, or newest, comment is to be displayed first.

### Email me whenever

These two settings give you control of when authors and administrators receive notification that comments have been made, or that comments are held for moderation. Please note that the use of âmeâ refers to either a post author or the administrator (person whose email address is used for admin purposes).

- **Anyone posts a comment** â Check this box so that every single comment posted will generate an email to the author of that post. Be warned that if your posts receive a large number of comments, post authors may find a very full email Inbox. If you wish to micromanage comments, then by all means, activate this setting by checking the box.
- **A comment is held for moderation** â Check this box if you want WordPress to send notification that a comment is being held for moderation. The email notification is sent to the E-mail address listed in the [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#general) &gt; [General](/support/article/settings-general-screen/) Screen. This is useful if your blog has multiple authors and each author is authorized to allow or decline comments. That way, you, the owner of the site, can review what comments are being allowed or denied.

### Before a comment appears

These settings provide you even more control over the instances of when and how comments are posted.

- **An administrator must always approve the comment** â Select this option to force comments to be approved by a blog user or owner having the proper [Role](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/) to approve comments, even if the comments appear to be spam . See the Comment Moderation options below regarding spam.
- **Comment author must have a previously approved comment** â Check the box to insure comments are only posted if the comment authorâs email address matches the address of a previously approved comment, otherwise, the comment is held for moderation. Comments from blocked email addresses (those listed in the Local Spam Words Text Box) are held for moderation regardless of whitelist status.

### Comment Moderation

In the [Comment Moderation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation) section you specify these options to help you deal with [Comment Spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Spam).

- **Hold a comment in the queue if it contains \[X\] or more links (A common characteristic of comment spam is a large number of hyperlinks.)** â Not too long ago, comment spammers would have five, ten, or more hyperlinks in their comment spam. This made it very easy for bloggers to quickly screen comments but spammers recognized that and commonly use only one or two hyperlinks. You can enter a number in this box to tell WordPress how many links you allow in a comment before holding it for moderation.
- **When a comment contains any of these words in its content, name, URL, e-mail, IP or browserâs user-agent string it will be held in the moderation queue. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so âpressâ will match âWordPressâ** â In this text box you can add your own spam words which will filter the comments when posted.

### Comment Blocklist

Previous to WordPress version 5.4, this was named âComment Blacklistâ.

- **When a comment contains any of these words in its content, author name, URL, e-mail, IP address or browserâs user-agent string, it will be marked as spam. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so âpressâ will match âWordPressâ**. This text box acts the same as âWhen a comment conatins any of these wordsâ¦â except comments which match these words will be **deleted without warning**. You may want to use this as a last resort, as genuine comments can end up deleted

### Avatars

An avatar is an image that follows you from weblog to weblog appearing beside your name when you comment on avatar enabled sites. Here you can enable the display of avatars for people who comment on your blog. By default WordPress uses Gravatars â short for Globally Recognized Avatars â for the pictures that show up next to comments. Plugins may override this.

#### Avatar display

- **Donât show Avatars** â Check this radio button to suppress avatar display in comments.

# Inserting images into posts and pages (Classic Editor) <a name="documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages-classic" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages-classic/

## Overview

When creating or editing a WordPress page or blog post, you can easily add images at any time using the WordPress Media Uploader tool. Hereâs how to add an image, step-by-step, using the media uploader:

## Step 1 â Placing your cursor

[![Cursor at beginning of a paragraph](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/add-image-insert-cursor.png?fit=502%2C182&ssl=1)](#documentation/files/2018/11/add-image-insert-cursor.png)Placing cursor where the image should appearIn order to add an image to your page or post, you must first insert your cursor in the place in the text where you want the image to appear. By placing your cursor within your text, you can add images inline with your content. You can also place your cursor on a blank line if you want the image to appear by itself instead.  
  
*Tip: Itâs a good idea to **place your cursor on the left margin of your text**, even if you want the image to appear on the right. Thatâs because there is a special setting called Alignment that allows you to control whether the image appears on the right or the left side of the text. It even controls how text flows around the image automatically.*

## Step 2 â Click the Add Media button

Once youâve placed your cursor on the line where you want your image to appear, click on the Add Media button to launch the media uploader interface, and then select the Insert Media option from the list of actions in the left side of the media uploader window.

[![Add Media button circled](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/add-media-button.png?fit=568%2C193&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/add-media-button.png?fit=568%2C193&ssl=1)âAdd Mediaâ button above editor## Step 3 â Add or Select Your Image

You can add or select the image you want to add to your page or post by choosing from either of the following options in the center of the media uploader window:

- **Upload Files:** Upload the image you want to use from your computer by dragging it into the upload area.
- **Media Library:** Select from any previously uploaded images in the media library by clicking on the one you wish to add to your page or post.

[![](#documentation/files/2018/11/media-uploader.png)](#documentation/files/2018/11/media-uploader.png)Once you have selected or uploaded the image you want to add, You will see a checkbox next to the thumbnail confirming your selection, and see information about it displayed in the Attachment Details pane on the right hand side of the media uploader interface.

## Step 4 â Attachment Details

[![Attachment details pane with: title, caption, alt text, and description](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/attachement-details.png?fit=376%2C464&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/attachement-details.png?fit=376%2C464&ssl=1)Attachment detailsThe **Attachment Details** pane displays a small un-cropped thumbnail of the image, as well as important information such as the filename, date uploaded, and image dimensions in pixels.

There are also action links that allow you to **Edit Image**, which takes you to the page, or to **Delete Permanently** to remove the image from your site.

In addition, you can edit the following media information:

- **Title:** The title of this media.
- **Caption:** The caption for this image. The text you enter here will be displayed below the image.
- **Alternate Text:** Enter the Alt text for the image, e.g. âThe Mona Lisaâ to describe the media.
- **Description:** A description for this particular media.

For more information on these media settings, see the [Edit Media](#documentation/article/edit-media) page.

## Step 5 â Attachment Display Settings

[![Attachment display settings: alignment, link to, and size](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/attachment-display-settings.png?fit=298%2C221&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/attachment-display-settings.png?fit=298%2C221&ssl=1)Attachment display settingsThe **Attachment Display Settings** pane controls how the image is displayed when viewed on the site.

You have options to set how you would like the image aligned on the page (in relation to the text and margins) and what the link behavior of the image will be, In addition you can set what size image you would like to display on your page.

### Image Alignment

The **Alignment** setting allows you to determine where you would like the image to appear in your content area and how it interacts with any text on the page. You have the following image alignment options to choose from:

- **Left:** Aligns the image on the left hand margin, and any text that is on the page wraps (or flows) around the image to the available space on the right.
- **Right:** Aligns the image on the right hand margin, and any text that is on the page wraps (or flows) around the image to the available space on the left.
- **Center:** Aligns the image to the center of the page, with no text displayed around it.
- **None:** Inserts the image in to the page with no alignment

[![Different image alignments](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/750px-image-alignment-4up.png?fit=750%2C566&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/750px-image-alignment-4up.png?fit=750%2C566&ssl=1)Aligning images using editor controls### Image Link

The Link To settings determine the URL/web address to which the image will be linked when clicked on by a visitor to your site. You can specify the following image link settings:

- **Attachment Page:** Links your inserted image to its WordPress media attachment page.
- **Media File:** Links your inserted image directly to the original, full-size version of the file.
- **Custom URL:** Allows you to set a custom link URL for your inserted image to link to when clicked.
- **None:** This setting will remove the link completely, rendering the image âun-clickableâ.

### Image Size

The Size settings determine the size of the image you are adding to your site. By default WordPress creates a range of four image size for you to choose from:

- **Thumbnail:** Displays a small thumbnail-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note, by default the Thumbnail size is a square, so some cropping of your original image may occur.
- **Medium:** Displays a medium-sized version of your image on the page/post. This is a good size to use with Left/Right alignments, as it leaves sufficient space for legible text to either side.
- **Large**: Displays a large-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space.
- **Full Size:** Displays a full-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space. If your original image is larger than this column width, the full size of the image may not be displayed.

[![Different image sizes](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/750px-image-sizes-3up.png?fit=750%2C265&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/750px-image-sizes-3up.png?fit=750%2C265&ssl=1)Different image sizesYou can visit the **[Settings &gt; Media](#documentation/article/settings-media-screen)** section of your WordPress dashboard to customize the above image sizes.

### Step 5 â Inserting the image

[![Selecting the edit image option whenever hovering over an image](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/400px-re-edit-image.png?fit=400%2C235&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/400px-re-edit-image.png?fit=400%2C235&ssl=1)Edit image optionOnce you have determined your image settings, click on the blue Insert into post or Insert into the page button, to add the image to your page or post. After the image uploader window closes, you will see the image in the text editor window, including a preview of the alignment of the image, if you have specified an image alignment.

At any time, you can edit the image settings by clicking on the **Edit Image** button in the upper left hand corner. You can remove the image from your page/post by clicking on the **Remove Image** button.

*Note: This document is for the Classic Editor. If you are using the block-editor on your site, the [Gallery Block is documented on this page](#documentation/article/gallery-block).*

## Overview

Image galleries are a great way to share groups of pictures on your WordPress site. The **Create Gallery** feature of the WordPress media uploader allows you to add a simple image gallery to pages or posts on your site.

[![A published gallery with captions](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/published-gallery.png?fit=710%2C686&ssl=1)](#documentation/files/2018/11/published-gallery.png)End result of published galleryThis article introduces how to add an image gallery using the media library, and explains gallery shortcode which will be generated and embedded into the post or page.

## Adding image gallery using media library

Hereâs how to add an image gallery step-by-step, using the media uploader:

*Note: Before adding a gallery, you should be comfortable using the* Add media *feature and the media uploader to [add images to your media library and place them into posts](/support/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages/).*

### Step 1 â Place your cursor

A gallery can go anywhere on a page or post â by itself on a blank page, or above, below, or in the midst of text. Start by placing your cursor where you want the gallery to appear â if itâs in between blocks of text, like in the photo example below, consider adding a return and placing your cursor on a new line so thereâs space above and below.

[![Placing cursor where gallery should be](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-place-cursor.png?fit=580%2C261&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-place-cursor.png?fit=580%2C261&ssl=1)Place cursor where gallery should be### Step 2 â Click the Add Media button

Once youâve placed your cursor where you want your image gallery to appear, click on the Add Media button (located left above the editing window) to launch the media uploader interface. In the resulting popup window, select the âCreate a Galleryâ option from the list of actions on the left.

[![Clicking the add media button above editor](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-add-media-button.png?fit=423%2C232&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-add-media-button.png?fit=423%2C232&ssl=1)Click âAdd Mediaâ button### Step 3 â Add and/or Select the Images You Want to Include

You can add or select the images you want to include in your image gallery by choosing from either of the following options in the center of the media uploader window:

- **Upload Files:** Upload the images you want to use from your computer by dragging them into the upload area. You can add more than one image, and they will be automatically grouped together as an image gallery.
- **Media Library:** Select from previously uploaded images in the media library by clicking on the ones you wish to add to the gallery. You will see a checkbox next to your selections.

[![Drag and drop files into media library to create gallery](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/drag-to-start-gallery.png?fit=628%2C415&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/drag-to-start-gallery.png?fit=628%2C415&ssl=1)Drag and drop multiple files to Media Library*Note: You can create an image gallery using any combination of new images and previously uploaded images simply by switching back and forth between the Upload Files and Media Library tabs.*

As you upload and/or select images, you will see your selection confirmed on the Insert Media screen by check boxes at the top corner of each thumbnail. Also, a row of thumbnails appears at the bottom of the window to help you keep track of all the images youâve selected. When you are happy with your selection, click the **Create a new gallery** button.

On the Edit Gallery page, you can do the following things before inserting the gallery you have created into your page or post:

- **Rearrange your images:** Drag and Drop image thumbnails to rearrange the order of images in your gallery.
- **Reverse Order:** Reverses the order of the images in your gallery.
- **Add image descriptions:** Add descriptions to your images (optional) which appear as image captions below each thumbnail in the gallery.
- **Remove images:** Hover over a thumbnail and click on the âXâ to remove any of the images you previously selected.
- **Add more images:** Click on the âAdd to Galleryâ link in the left hand sidebar and add or select the images you want to include in your image gallery by choosing from either âUpload Filesâ or âMedia Libraryâ tabs.
- **Cancel Gallery:** Click on the âCancel Galleryâ link from the actions on the left to exit the Edit Gallery page and cancel your image gallery.

- **Links To:** Controls whether the gallery thumbnails (on the published page/post) link to the image attachment page or directly to the source image file itself.
- **Columns:** Set the number of columns you would like to have in your gallery. 3 Columns is the default settings, which is ideal for most sites.
- **Random Order:** Enables your gallery to display your image thumbnails in a random order each time they are viewed on the site.
- **Size:** Changes each image size in gallery. Available options are Thumbnail, Media, Large and Full Size.

### Editing Existing Galleries

Within the visual editor, the image gallery is displayed as a series of thumbnail images.

[![Gallery in the WordPress TinyMCE editor](#documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-in-visual-editor-768x456.png)](#documentation/files/2018/11/gallery-in-visual-editor-768x456.png)Gallery in WordPress editorWhen you click any area of the image gallery, icon buttons appear top of the area. At any time, you can edit the images or settings of your gallery by clicking on the Edit button. You can remove the image gallery at any time by clicking on the Remove button.

[![Click pencil icon to edit image](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/edit-gallery.png?fit=336%2C237&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/edit-gallery.png?fit=336%2C237&ssl=1)Edit image to edit## Gallery shortcode

Above steps generates Gallery shortcode with image ids and other options, and embedded into the Post or Page, like this:

```
[gallery ids="729,732,731,720"]
```

You can specify options direct to this shortcode.

### Usage

# Settings Permalinks screen <a name="documentation/article/settings-permalinks-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-permalinks-screen/

**Permalinks** are the permanent URLs to your individual pages and blog posts, as well as your category and tag archives. A permalink is the web address used to link to your content. The URL to each post should be permanent and never change â hence the name permalink.

The **Settings Permalinks Screen** allows you to choose your default permalink structure. You can choose from common settings or create custom URL structures. You must click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the screen for the new settings to take effect.

By default, WordPress uses web URLs that have day and name in them; however, WordPress offers you the ability to create a custom URL structure for your permalinks and archives. This can improve the aesthetics, usability, and forward compatibility of your links.

For an introduction to Permalinks, read the [Pretty Permalinks](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/#pretty-permalinks) section of [Introduction to Blogging](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/). For a more in-depth description of the way this structure is specified, see the [Using Permalinks](#documentation/article/using-permalinks) article.

[![WordPress permalink settings screen](#documentation/files/2022/11/wordpress-permalink-settings.png)](#documentation/files/2022/11/wordpress-permalink-settings.png)## Customize Permalink structure

A [number of tags are available](/support/article/using-permalinks/#structure-tags-1), and here are some examples to get you started.

### Common settings 

Check one of the radio buttons corresponding to the correct Permalink Structure for your blog.

- **Plain** â An example of the default structure is **http://www.sample.com/?p=123**
- **Day and name** â An example of the day and name based structure is **http://www.sample.com/2008/03/31/sample-post/**
- **Month and name** â An example of the month and name based structure is **http://www.sample.com/2008/03/sample-post/**
- **Numeric** â An example of the numeric structure is **http://www.sample.com/archives/123**
- **Post name** â An example of the post name structure is **http://www.sample.com/sample-post**
- **Custom structure** â In the box specify the custom structure you desire to use. One example is **/archives/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/**. Look at the [Permalink Structure Tags](/support/article/using-permalinks/#structure-tags).

### Optional 

You may enter custom bases for your category and tag URLs here. For example, using **/topics/** as your category base would make your category links like **http://example.org/topics/uncategorized/**. If you leave these blank the defaults will be used. Again, see the [Permalink Structure Tags](/support/article/using-permalinks/#structure-tags).

- **Category base** â Enter a custom prefix for your category URLs here.
- **Tag base** â Enter a custom prefix for your tag URLs here.

### Save Changes

Click the **Save Changes** button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved.

After youâve clicked this button, you should receive one of two messages depending on whether your [.htaccess](/support/article/glossary/#htaccess) file is writeable.

- If [.htaccess](/support/article/glossary/#htaccess) is writeable, you will get a message that says â**Permalink structure updated.**â Youâre all set; WordPress has been able to do everything for you automatically.
- If [.htaccess](https://wp-helphub.com/support/article/glossary/#htaccess) is *not* writeable, you will see a message at the top of the screen that says â**You should update your .htaccess now.**â. Near the bottom of the screen you will see â**If your .htaccess file were writable, we could do this automatically, but it isnât so these are the mod\_rewrite rules you should have in your [.htaccess](https://wp-helphub.com/support/article/glossary/#htaccess) file. Click in the field and press CTRL + a to select all.**â This means youâll have to do one extra step yourself. In the text box at the bottom of the Screen, WordPress displays several lines of [rewrite](/support/article/glossary/#mod_rewrite) rules associated with the Permalink Structure you designated above. You need to manually copy everything in this text box into your [.htaccess](https://wp-helphub.com/support/article/glossary/#htaccess) file to make your new Permalinks work.

For information on how to make [.htaccess](/support/article/glossary/#htaccess) writeable, see [Changing File Permissions](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing File Permissions>).

**Note**: Visiting the Permalinks screen triggers a flush of rewrite rules. There is no need to save just to flush the rewrite rules.

**Note**: If youâre writing your [.htaccess](/support/article/glossary/#htaccess) file on your own local computer, remember, some operating systems do not allow the creation of a file named â`.htaccess`â because of the initial dot (â**`.`**â). You can always name the file without the initial dot or with a standard extension (e.g. â`htaccess.txt`â). Once the file is uploaded to your weblogâs directory, rename it with your [FTP](/support/article/glossary/#ftp) software. Most [FTP Clients](/support/article/ftp-clients/) should provide you a way to rename files this.

**Also Note**: Files that begin with a dot (â**`.`**â) like â`.htaccess`â are hidden on most servers by default. Consult the user guide or FAQ of the FTP software you use to find out how to have the software display these hidden files, and also how to use the software to change file permissions, rename files, etc. For more information on all of this see [Changing File Permissions](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Changing File Permissions>).

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/customize-date-and-time-format/

## Customizing the Time and Date Format

Certain WordPress tag functions are used to display or return date and time information; [the\_date()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_date/) and [the\_time()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_time/) are examples of this.

By default, these functions will display or return date and time in format as it is set in [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#general) &gt; [General](/support/article/settings-general-screen/). This is the place where customizing format for Date and Time will take effect throughout the whole WordPress installation.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/time-and-date-settings.png)Formatting Date and TimeNotice the string of characters next to each Date and Time formatting in screenshot. This string is called a **format string**. Each letter represents specific part of Date or Time.

For example, the format string:

```
l, F j, Y
```

creates a date that look like this (note that commas are read literally):

```
Friday, September 24, 2004
```

Here is what each format character in the string above represents:

- `l` = Full name for day of the week (lower-case L).
- `F` = Full name for the month.
- `j` = The day of the month.
- `Y` = The year in 4 digits. (lower-case y gives the yearâs last 2 digits)

Format characters are standardized and globally used in [PHP](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#PHP) programming language. As WordPress is written in PHP programming language you can use the table of Date and Time format characters [directly from the PHP website](http://php.net/date).

Here is a table of some of the more useful items found there:

| Day of Month |
|---|
| `d` | Numeric, with leading zeros | 01â31 |
| `j` | Numeric, without leading zeros | 1â31 |
| `S` | The English suffix for the day of the month | st, nd or th in the 1st, 2nd or 15th. |
| Weekday |
| `l` | Full name (lowercase âLâ) | Sunday â Saturday |
| `D` | Three letter name | Mon â Sun |
| Month |
| `m` | Numeric, with leading zeros | 01â12 |
| `n` | Numeric, without leading zeros | 1â12 |
| `F` | Textual full | January â December |
| `M` | Textual three letters | Jan â Dec |
| Year |
| `Y` | Numeric, 4 digits | Eg., 1999, 2003 |
| `y` | Numeric, 2 digits | Eg., 99, 03 |
| Time |
| `a` | Lowercase | am, pm |
| `A` | Uppercase | AM, PM |
| `g` | Hour, 12-hour, without leading zeros | 1â12 |
| `h` | Hour, 12-hour, with leading zeros | 01â12 |
| `G` | Hour, 24-hour, without leading zeros | 0-23 |
| `H` | Hour, 24-hour, with leading zeros | 00-23 |
| `i` | Minutes, with leading zeros | 00-59 |
| `s` | Seconds, with leading zeros | 00-59 |
| `T` | Timezone abbreviation | Eg., EST, MDT â¦ |
| Full Date/Time |
| `c` | ISO 8601 | 2004-02-12T15:19:21+00:00 |
| `r` | [RFC 2822](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 "RFC 2822") | Thu, 21 Dec 2000 16:01:07 +0200 |
| `U` | Unix timestamp (seconds since Unix Epoch) | 1455880176 |

## Format String Examples

Here are some examples of date format with the result output.

- `F j, Y g:i a` â November 6, 2010 12:50 am
- `F j, Y` â November 6, 2010
- `F, Y` â November, 2010
- `g:i a` â 12:50 am
- `g:i:s a` â 12:50:48 am
- `l, F jS, Y` â Saturday, November 6th, 2010
- `M j, Y @ G:i` â Nov 6, 2010 @ 0:50
- `Y/m/d \a\t g:i A` â 2010/11/06 at 12:50 AM
- `Y/m/d \a\t g:ia` â 2010/11/06 at 12:50am
- `Y/m/d g:i:s A` â 2010/11/06 12:50:48 AM
- `Y/m/d` â 2010/11/06

## Overriding General Settings Formatting

Functions for Time and Date accept **format string** as a parameter in order to override default Date and Time formatting for certain places in theme or plugin files. Just the same as in [General Settings](/support/article/settings-general-screen/), this format string is a template of characters where each character represents specific part of Date or Time.

Inside the template file, setting the Date and Time format string as a parameter for [`the_time()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/the_time/) template tag, would look something like this:

```
Posted on <?php the_time( 'l, F jS, Y' ); ?>.
```

Which will render on the frontend of your site as following:

```
Posted on Friday, September 24th, 2004.
```

## Localization

To localize Date and Time, use the [wp\_date()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_date/) function. The `wp_date()` function basically behaves like the PHP [date()](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) function, except that it also translates things like month names and weekdays and similar into the current locale for the site. You can replace a call to `date()` with a call to `wp_date()`, using the same arguments.

```
$date = wp_date( 'F j, Y' );
$time = wp_date( 'g:i a' );
```

Alternatively, you can wrap your predefined format in [\_\_()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/__/) or [\_e()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/_e/) in order to allow translators to adjust the Date and Time to the proper local format. If you do so, then you should also include a translator comment, to let the translators know what the date format is referring to and where it is used, so they can convert it accurately.

```
__( 'Y/m/d g:i:s a', 'textdomain' );
```

## Escaping

Some letters do not have an associated format in the PHP date function. For example `x` passed in the format string will currently return a literal `x`. However, this can change at some point in the future and `x` may have a format associated with it.

This is why you should always escape literal character in a date formatted string with `\`. Note that, in following example, every letter of word `of` is escaped.

```
wp_date( __( 'l jS \o\f F Y', 'textdomain' ) );
```

This example will render as following on the frontend of your site:

```
Saturday 25th of February 2017
```

# Write code in your posts (Classic Editor) <a name="documentation/article/write-code-in-your-posts-classic-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/write-code-in-your-posts-classic-editor/

Whether you write [plugins](/support/article/plugins/) or hacks for WordPress, or you want to add bits and pieces of code about your own WordPress site or other [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_(disambiguation)#Computing) code like HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript, putting code in your [post](/support/article/writing-posts/) that *looks* like code, but doesnât *behave* like code, is a frequent challenge for bloggers.

By default, the way a piece of code written or pasted to WordPress [post editor](/support/article/writing-posts/) is interpreted depends on whether you use visual or HTML post editor. Visual editor will consider the code to be an ordinary text, converting (encoding) the &lt; and &gt; characters into their &lt; and &gt; [character entity](/support/article/glossary#character-entity) equivalents, so that the code is not interpreted by a web browser. Quotes are converted too, but remember that by default, WordPress also applies [auto-correction](#quotes-auto-correction) so that the text is quoted properly according to your language specifics. HTML editor does not convert any of these characters, so be aware that HTML and CSS markup you use in your code examples will be recognized by a web browser and you may end up with a funky looking text and a messed up layout.

Note that this behavior may differ with respect to the WordPress version, post editor and other plugins used. In some older versions of WordPress, unrecognized uses of the &lt; and &gt; characters were converted into the &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; character entities, and when an [HTML tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element) was found within the post, the tag was left as it was, allowing for its interpretation in a web browser.

## Code Within Paragraphs

The HTML tag which will turn text into a `monospaced` font. They are &lt;code&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;. The latter is rarely used today, replaced by the more useful and semantically correct &lt;code&gt;, which distinguishes text that is computer code from natural language.

```
This is an example which mentions code within a paragraph,<br></br>namely the functions <code>wp_title()</code>, <br></br><code>wp_content()</code> and <code>wp_footer()</code>, <br></br>which are very useful in WordPress.
```

This is great for making a piece of non-HTML text look like code, but what about HTML tags that you want to showcase?

```
In the header.php template file,<br></br>look for the <code><div class="header"></code><br></br>section to change the <code><h1></code> heading.
```

Using the `` tag doesnât tell WordPress to encode HTML markup within the tag or strip it from the post. WordPress thinks that you are using this markup for formatting, leaving it untouched. A web browser then sees a `` tag followed by a `<div>` tag and so it responds by creating a new container in your web page.

To avoid this behavior, use [character entities or extended characters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Fun_Character_Entities) to represent the left and right arrow characters in a way that is not recognized as the beginning and end of an HTML tag by a web browser, like this:

```
In the header.php template file,<br></br>look for the <code>&lt;div class="header"&gt;</code><br></br>section to change the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading.<br></br><br></br>
```

## URLs Within Paragraphs

By default, WordPress will turn any phrase that begins with *http:* into a link. If you are giving an example of how to link to a specific post within a WordPress site, instead of using the link with *`http://example.com/index.php?p=453`* and having it turn into a link, you can use extended characters for the slashes, so WordPress wonât âseeâ the link:

```
...link to a specific WordPress post using <br></br><code>http:& amp;#47;& amp;#47;example.com& amp;#47;index.php?p=453</code><br></br>in your post....
```

Note: Take off Space between â&amp;â and âampâ.

## List of Related Character Entities

Here is a list of some HTML character entities related to the topic of this article:

```
(less than) = &lt; or &#060;
(greater than) = &gt; or &#062;
/ = &#047;
] = &#093;
[ = &#091;
" = &quot; or &#034;
' = &#039;
â = &ldquo; or &#8220;
â = &rdquo; or &#8220;
â = &lsquo; or &#8216;
â = &rsquo; or &#8217;
(ampersand) = &amp; or &#038;
```

There is a list of resources below which will help you turn HTML tags into character entities automatically, so you donât have to memorize these character codes.

## Using the &lt;pre&gt; tag

To set your code aside so that it looks like a box of code which may be copied and pasted within other code or template file, you can use the &lt;pre&gt; HTML tag.

The &lt;pre&gt; tag instructs the browser to use a monospaced font, but to *exactly reproduce* whatever is inside of the &lt;pre&gt;tags. Every space, line break, every bit of code is exactly reproduced.

```
<h3>Section Three Title</h3><br></br><p>This is the start of a <br></br><a title="article on relationships" href="goodtalk.php"><br></br>good relationship</a> between you and me....
```

Using the &lt;pre&gt; tag isnât very âprettyâ but it does the job. Examples of how to style it can be found in the next section. Still, it showcases the code *exactly*.

By *exactly*, we mean EXACTLY. If you have a long line of code, it will run off the page because there are no *instructions*which tell the code to wrap. It wonât. Here is an example:

```
<h3>Section Three Title</h3><p>This is the start of a <a title="article on relationships"<br></br>href="goodtalk.php">good relationship</a> between you and I and I think you should read it because it is<br></br>important that we have these little <a title="article on communication"<br></br>href="communication.php">conversations</a> once in a while to let each other know how we feel....
```

Not pretty, is it. To avoid this screen run-off, put in line breaks. Unfortunately, deciding where to put those line breaks in when you are showcasing code that will be copied makes it a difficult decision.

If you are familiar with programming language, you will know when a line break wonât mess up a line of code, so choose there. If you are unfamiliar with where to put line breaks, experiment. Put the code in, make the line breaks, and then test the code. If it works, then use the line break there. If not, change the line break position.

If you have long lines of code, consider showcasing only excerpts and providing a link to the full code placed on your site in a text or PHP file, or using one of the many online pastebins which are available for temporarily showcasing code.

## Troubleshooting Codes

Writing code within a WordPress post can be a challenge, maybe forcing you to override the WordPress default styles and to use filters which âfixâ what we write. If you are having trouble with writing code within your WordPress post, this section might help.

### Quotes Auto-correction

A frequent problem when using codes within your post is the quotes auto-correction feature of WordPress, mostly known from word processing software. By default, when serving a web page, WordPress converts the **â**straight**â** quotes into the opening and closing âcurlyâ quotation marks according to your WordPress [installation language](/support/article/installing-wordpress-in-your-language/) set in the *wp-config.php* file. Note that the auto-correction (also called smart quotes) feature is applied regardless of whether you have written the quotes in visual or HTML post editor.

In HTML post editor, you can avoid this problem by wrapping the quotes with the &lt;code&gt;, &lt;tt&gt; or &lt;pre&gt; tags. Other solution is replacing quotes with their respective character entities, e.g. using:

```
<code><p class=& #34;red& #34;></code>    // Take off space between & and #
```

instead of:

```
<p class="red">
```

Note that in some older versions of WordPress, if you edited a page again after publishing it, the HTML editor replaced all these entities with their literal equivalents. For example, if you carefully used &amp;#34 for your quotes, they would have come back as â, and if saved, the auto-correction feature would have an effect on them.

# Introduction to Blogging <a name="documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging/

You are living in the age of technology, and you would have encountered terms like blogging, blog, and bloggers. People often need clarification about these terms. This document will discuss the concepts associated with blogging and explain the role of content and comments in the quality of blogging.

## What is blogging?

Blogging deals with the regular sharing of information in the form of blogs on the internet. Understanding the blog concept is essential to get an insight into blogging.

## What is a blog?

A âblogâ is an updated version of the old term âweblog,â used to describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information. A blog features diary-type commentary and links to articles on other websites, usually presented as a list of entries in reverse chronological order. Blogs range from personal to political and can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects.

Many blogs focus on web design, home staging, sports, mobile technology, etc. Few are more eclectic, presenting links to all types of other sites. And others are more like personal journals, presenting the authorâs daily life and thoughts.

Generally speaking (although there are exceptions), blogs tend to have a few things in common:

- A main content area with articles listed chronologically, the newest on top. Often, the articles are organized into categoriesâan archive of older articles.
- A way for people to leave comments about the articles.
- A list of links to other related sites is sometimes called a âblogroll.â
- One or more â[feeds](#support/article/introduction-to-blogging)â like RSS, Atom, or RDF files.

Some blogs may have additional features beyond these. Watch this [short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NN2I1pWXjXI) for a simple explanation of what a blog is.

## What is a blogger?

A blogger is a person who owns, runs, or maintains a blog. That is, posting articles or new posts, information, and sharing the most up-to-date news, opinions, and case studies, to name but a few.

## The blog content

Content has a central importance in any website. The nature of content depends on the type of business. Retail sites feature a catalog of products. University sites contain information about their campuses, curriculum, and faculty. News sites show the latest news stories.

A blogger should update the content regularly. You might have a bunch of observations or reviews for a personal blog. Without updated content, there is little reason to visit a website more than once.

Some blogs have a single author, and some have multiple authors. Each author writes his/her own articles. Typically, blog authors compose their articles in a web-based interface built into the blogging system. Some blogging systems also support using [stand-alone âweblog clientâ software](#support/article/weblog-client), allowing authors to write articles offline and upload them later.

## Comments

Want an interactive website? Wouldnât it be nice if a websiteâs readers could leave comments, tips, or impressions about the site or a specific article? With blogs, they can! Posting comments is one of the most exciting features of blogs. Most blogs have a method to allow visitors to [leave comments](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging). There are also nifty ways for authors of other blogs to leave comments without even visiting the blog! Called â[pingbacks](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging)â or â[trackbacks](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging).â They can inform other bloggers whenever they cite an article from another site in their own articles. It helps maintain online conversation painlessly among various site users and websites.

## The difference between a blog and a CMS?

Software that manages your website is commonly called a CMS or [âContent Management System](#support/article/Glossary).â Many blogging software programs are considered a specific type of CMS. They provide the features required to create and maintain a blog. They can make publishing on the internet as simple as writing an article, giving it a title, and organizing it under (one or more) categories. While some CMS programs offer vast and sophisticated features, an essential blogging tool provides an interface where you can work in an easy and, to some degree, intuitive manner. At the same time, it handles the logistics involved in making your composition presentable and publicly available. In other words, you get to focus on what you want to write, and the blogging tool takes care of the rest of the site management.

WordPress is an advanced blogging tool that provides a rich set of [features](#support/article/wordpress-features). Through its [Administration Screen](#support/article/administration-screens), you can set options for the behavior and presentation of your weblog. Via these [Administration Screen](#support/article/administration-screens), you can easily compose a [blog post](#support/article/glossary), push a button, and be published on the internet instantly! WordPress takes great pains to see that your blog posts look good, the text looks beautiful, and the HTML code it generates conforms to web standards.

If youâre just starting, read [Getting Started with WordPress](#documentation/article/get-started-with-wordpress), which contains information on how to get WordPress set up quickly and effectively and on performing basic tasks within WordPress, like creating new posts or editing existing ones.

## Blogging tips

Starting a new blog is complex and can put many people off. Some may get off to a good start only to become quickly discouraged because of the lack of comments or visits. You want to stand out from this crowd of millions of bloggers and be one of the few hundred thousand blogs that are visited. Here are some simple tips to help you on your way to blogging mastery:

1. Post regularly, but donât post if you have nothing worth posting about.
2. Stick with only a few specific genres to talk about.
3. Donât put âsubscribeâ and âvote meâ links all over the front page until you have people that like your blog enough to ignore them (theyâre usually just in the way).
4. Use a clean and simple theme.
5. Enjoy a blog for fun, and comment on other peoplesâ blogs (as they usually visit back).
6. Have fun blogging, and remember, there are no rules to what you post on your blog!

# Use automated installation <a name="documentation/article/use-automated-installation" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-automated-installation/

Although WordPress is very easy to install, you can use one of the one-click auto-installers typically available from hosting companies. The most popular auto-installers, [APS](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#APS_.28Plesk.29), [Fantastico](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Fantastico), [Installatron](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Installatron), and [Softaculous](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress#Softaculous) are described here.

## APS (Plesk)

If youâre using the Plesk control panel, you have two options: one-click quick install or custom install which allows you to configure things like installation path or database prefix. Both these options are available regardless of whether you have [WordPress Toolkit](http://www.plesk.com/#solutions) enabled or not. However, special security measures are applied during installation only if WordPress Toolkit is enabled. If you donât have WordPress Toolkit, your WordPress installations will have the same security as manual WordPress installs.

1. Log in to your Plesk account and go to Applications tab. The Featured Applications screen will open.
2. Click **Install** next to WordPress if you want a one-click quick install, or click the drop-down arrow next to Install and click **Custom** if you want to change installation parameters.
3. If you chose quick installation, no need to do anything else, as your WordPress blog has already been installed. If you chose custom installation, change the settings you want and click **Install**.

# Posts screen <a name="documentation/article/posts-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-screen/

The Posts Screen provides the facility to manage all the Posts in a blog. Via this Screen, Posts can be edited, deleted, and viewed. Filtering, and searching, also makes it easy to quickly find Posts matching certain criteria.

A powerful bulk edit feature allows Posts to be edited in bulk (en masse) allowing fields such as Author, Comments Allowed, Status, Pings Allowed, and Sticky to be changed for a whole batch of Posts. It is important to note that Categories and Tags can be ADDED in bulk to a set of Posts, but it is not possible to CHANGE, or DELETE, a Category, or Tag, for those Posts. In addition, a Quick Edit feature provides an easy method to change a mulititude of values, such as Title, Slug, Date, and Category, for a given Post.

## Edit Posts

### Table of Posts

A table lists all of your Posts, by row. The Posts are listed with the newest Post first.

[![WordPress administration post list screen](#documentation/files/2018/11/manageposts-768x528.png)](#documentation/files/2018/11/manageposts-768x528.png)Administration post list screenThe table of Posts contains the following columns:

- **\[ \]** â This checkbox, when clicked (checked), âselectsâ that particular Post to be processed by a Bulk Action.
- **Title** â This is the Postâs Title displayed as a link. Click the Title link to allow this Post to be edited. Next to the Title, if a Post is of a Draft, Private, Pending, Sticky, or Password Protected nature, bold text will display showing that.
- **âIDâ** â This is not a column in the Table, but by hovering the mouse over the Post Title, the Post ID is revealed as part of the URL displayed in the browser status bar (in Firefox the status bar is displayed at the bottom of the screen). A Postâs ID number is the unique number WordPressâ database uses to identify individual Posts.
- **Author** â Displayed in the form of a link, this is the [author](#documentation/article/users-your-profile-screen) who wrote the Post. Clicking the author link causes all the Posts authored by that user to be displayed in the Table of Posts (thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all Posts for a given author).
- **Categories** â Displays all the Categories, in the form of links, to which this Post belongs. Each Category link, when clicked will cause the list of Posts assigned that Category to be displayed in the Table of Posts (note the Category Filter box at the top of the Table will depict the Category being displayed).
- **Tags** â Displays all the Tags, in the form of links, associated with a Post. Each Tag link, when clicked will cause the list of Posts assigned that Tag to be displayed in the Table of Posts.
- **comment bubble** â A comment bubble is the column heading, and each Post row has comment bubble with the number of comments for that Post. If a Posts has any comments, then the number comments is displayed in a blue bubble. Clicking on a blue comment bubble causes the [Comments Screen](/support/article/comments-in-wordpress/) to be displayed to allow moderation of those comments.
- **Date** â The Date column for each Post shows the Date âPublishedâ for Published Posts or the Date âLast Modifiedâ for other Posts. If the Post is a âfuture Post,â the scheduled date for publishing is displayed.

#### Sortable Columns

Some column headings, such as the Title, Author, and Date, can be clicked to sort the Table of Posts in ascending or descending order. Hover over the column title, for example Title, to see the up-arrow or down-arrow. Click the heading to change the sort order.

#### View

Just to the right above the Table of Posts, two icons, List View, and Excerpt View, can be clicked to determine the amount of information listed with each Post. The default view is the List View and only the Post Title is listed for each Post. Click the Excerpt View to cause an [excerpt](/support/article/glossary#excerpt) for the Post to be displayed just below the Post Title.

#### Page Navigation

Under the Screen Options, the number of Posts displayed per page is determined. If more then one page of Posts is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided. Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward. Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display.

#### Screen Options

The Screen Options allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options. In addition, the number of Posts per page can be set.

#### Search

Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the âSearch Postsâ button to search and display all the Posts meeting your search words.

### Filtering Options

At the top of this Screen are links such as All, Published, Schedules, Pending Review, Draft, Private, that when clicked, will cause just the Posts of that type to be displayed in the underlying Table.

Below that, and to the right of the [Bulk Actions](#actions) [Apply button](#apply), are two other filter options:

**Show all dates**

This dropdown allows you to select, by date, which Posts are displayed in the [Table of Posts](#documentation/article/posts-screen). By default, âShow all datesâ is selected and all of your Posts are displayed.

**View all categories**

This dropdown allows you to select, by Category, which Posts are displayed in the [Table of Posts](#documentation/article/posts-screen). By default, âShow all categoriesâ is selected and all of your Posts are displayed.

**Filter**

Clicking this button applies the settings you select in the dropdowns.

### Using Selection, Actions, and Apply

#### Selection

This Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more Posts selected in the Table. For Bulk Actions to be performed on multiple Posts at once, those Posts must be first **selected** via one of these methods:

- **Select one Post at a time** â To select a Post, the checkbox to the left of the Post entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Posts by checking their respective checkbox.

#### Actions

Actions describe the process to be performed on particular Posts. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as *Bulk Actions* and *Immediate Actions*. The following describes these Actions:

- **Bulk Actions** â These Actions can be performed on one, or more Posts, at one time, if those Posts have been previously [selected](#documentation/article/posts-screen). Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk Actions pulldown box, above the Table. The only Bulk Actions allowed are Edit and Delete.

The available Actions are described below:

- **Edit** â This Action can be either an âImmediate Actionâ or a âBulk Actionâ. The Immediate Action, initiated by click on the Post Title or clicking on the Edit option just below the Post Title, causes the [Edit Posts screen](#documentation/article/writing-posts) to display. Edit is also available as a Bulk Action for the selected Posts, so see the [Bulk Edit section](#documentation/article/posts-screen) for details on the Bulk Editing process.

##### Bulk Edit

The Bulk Edit Posts âscreenâ is displayed below the Table Of Posts header once, one, or more Posts, have been [selected](#documentation/article/posts-screen), and the [Bulk Action](#documentation/article/posts-screen) of Edit is [Applied](#documentation/article/posts-screen). Bulk Edit allows the fields, Author, Comments Allowed, Status, Pings Allowed, and Sticky, to be changed for all the selected Posts. **It is important to note, Categories and Tags can be ADDED in bulk to a set of Posts, but it is not possible to CHANGE, or DELETE, a Category, or Tag, for those Posts.**

- **Cancel** â Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Bulk Edit of these Posts.

##### Quick Edit

Quick Edit is an Immediate Action performed on one Post by clicking the Quick Edit link, under the Post Title in the Table of Posts. Quick Edit is just an in-line edit that allows you to change the following itemsâTitle, Slug, Date, Author, Password or Private post box, Categories, Tags, Allow Comments, Allow Pings, Status, and Make this a post-sticky.

- **Cancel** â Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Edit of this Post.

##### Editing Individual Posts

This mode is essentially the same as the [Posts Add New Screen](#documentation/article/writing-posts) so see the [Posts\_Add\_New\_Screen](#documentation/article/writing-posts) for the specific details of writing a Post. The only difference is that the button to save your work is called â**Update**â instead of â**Publish**â.

#### Apply

After one or more Posts are *selected*, and after a *Bulk* Action is specified, the **Apply** button performs the given Action on the selected Posts.

- **Apply** â Click the Apply button to execute the Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pulldown, on the selected Posts. Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Posts must be **selected**, as described before.

# Set blog content visibility (Classic Editor) <a name="documentation/article/content-visibility-classic-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/content-visibility-classic-editor/

Content visibility is about controlling who can see your blog content. WordPress allows you to control the visibility of your posts and [Pages](/support/article/pages/) on an individual basis. By default, all posts and Pages are visible.

There are several ways to set the visibility for your blog content. You can set it on a per post/Page basis for public, private, or Password Protected, or make the entire blog private and Password Protected through the use of WordPress Plugins.

## Setting Page and Post Visibility

Visibility for posts and Pages is set from the **Edit** screen. The option is available under the âPublishâ option normally found at the top-right of the Edit screen. The screenshot below shows the interface, with the relevant section highlighted in the red rectangle.

[![Publish metabox with "Visibility" highlighted](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/visibility.jpg?fit=309%2C315&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/visibility.jpg?fit=309%2C315&ssl=1)Publish metabox

The default state for post and Page visibility is **Public**. Public visibility means that the content will be visible to the outside world as soon as it is published.

By clicking on the edit link next to **Visibility: Public** in the Publish options, you can choose from an expanded selection of visibility options.

[![Publish metabox displaying options: Public, Password protected, and Private](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/expanded_visibility.jpg?fit=305%2C338&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/expanded_visibility.jpg?fit=305%2C338&ssl=1)Publish metabox visibility options

The options are:

- **Public:** The default, viewable to all.
- **Password Protected:** Clicking this radio button followed by âOKâ causes a further text box to appear, into which you can enter a password.
- **Private:** This option hides the content from the public completely.

### Password Protected Content

Password Protected content is not immediately visible to the outside world. Instead, visitors will see a prompt similar to this:

[![Password protected page asking user to enter a password to view content](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/protected_post.jpg?fit=540%2C185&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/protected_post.jpg?fit=540%2C185&ssl=1)Password protected page

The title for your protected entry is shown, along with a password prompt. A visitor to your site must enter the password in the box in order to see the content of the post or Page.

### Private Content

Private content is published only for your eyes, or the eyes of only those with authorization permission levels to see private content. Normal users and visitors will not be aware of private content. It will not appear in the article lists. If a visitor were to guess the URL for your private post, they would still not be able to see your content. You will only see the private content when you are logged into your WordPress blog.

[![Publish metabox with visibility set to private](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/private_visibility.jpg?fit=300%2C222&ssl=1)](#documentation/files/2018/11/private_visibility.jpg)Publish metabox with visibility set to private

Once you change the visibility to private, the post or page status changes to âPrivately Publishedâ as shown. Private posts are automatically published but not visible to anyone but those with the appropriate permission levels (Editor or Administrator).

**WARNING:** If your site has multiple editors or administrators, they will be able to see your protected and private posts in the **Edit** screen. They do not need the password to be able to see your protected posts. They can see the private posts in the **Edit** Posts/Pages list, and are able to modify them, or even make them public. Consider these consequences before making such posts in such a multiple-user environment.

## Hiding The Entire WordPress Blog

Currently the functionality to hide your entire blog from public view, or to restrict it to certain users, is not part of the core WordPress product. There are possible plans to introduce this functionality into a later version.

There are various WordPress Plugins to restrict the visibility such as:

- [Page Restrict](#plugins/pagerestrict)
- [Force Login](#plugins/wp-force-login)
- [jonradio Private Site](#plugins/jonradio-private-site)

Alternatively, you could use the `.htaccess` to restrict who can visit your web site, but this is beyond the scope of this document.

# Use Images <a name="documentation/article/use-images" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-images/

## Working with Images

Adding images in WordPress is very easy. All of your images will be stored and can be managed in the Media Library, but you can take several different paths to get there.

The most common path is adding an image directly to a post or page. This automatically saves the image in the Media Library and displays the image wherever you inserted it.

You can also add images directly to the Media Library through the multi-file loader or the single-file loader.

- [Media Add New Screen](#documentation/article/media-add-new-screen)
- [Edit Media](#documentation/article/edit-media)
- [Settings Media Screen](#documentation/article/settings-media-screen)

## Adding Images Through Pages/Posts

When writing or editing a post, you can add an image using the Add Media button above the editor box. This opens a window that displays the multi-file uploader. From here you can drag and drop your picture or select it using the file selector.

The images you add here will be automatically added to the Media Library.

# Customizer <a name="documentation/article/customizer" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/customizer/

[WordPress Version 3.4](#documentation/wordpress-version/version-3-4) introduced Theme Customizer, which allows you to play around with various looks and settings for your current theme or one youâre thinking about switching to without publishing those changes to the whole world. For themes that support it, you can change colors, backgrounds, custom image headers, and so on.

If you select Appearance -&gt; Customize menu from the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens), Theme Customizer is launched. The Customizer allows you to preview changes to your site before publishing them. If you directly modify theme files and they are updated, then your modifications may be lost. By using Customizer you will ensure that your modifications are preserved.

**Important Note**:

The Customizer is only available if the active theme supports a Customize ability. For [Block themes](#documentation/article/block-themes) that support building your site with blocks, this means you will not need to use the Customizer causing it to be hidden except if you are using a plugin that requires it. In addition, this screen will likely be different for each Theme that enables and builds it. The Customizer for [WordPress Twenty Twenty-One theme](/support/article/twenty-twenty-one/), for example, provides options to change the background colors, select a background image and turn on the Dark Mode.

# Learn about WordPress origins and version history <a name="documentation/article/learn-about-wordpress-and-version-history" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/learn-about-wordpress-and-version-history/

WordPress was born out of a desire for an elegant, well-architectured personal publishing system built on PHP and MySQL and licensed under the GPL. It is the official successor of b2/cafelog. WordPress is modern software, but its roots and development go back to 2001. It is a mature and stable product. We hope that by focusing on user experience and web standards we can create a tool different from anything else out there.

There are also various post launch versions with improvements for security, bug fixes and stability. Please review the full [WordPress Release Archive](#news/category/releases) for details or check out the version announcements!

# Customize permalinks <a name="documentation/article/customize-permalinks" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/customize-permalinks/

Permalinks are the permanent URLs of your posts, pages, categories, and other archive pages on your website. These URLs are permanent and should never be changed â hence the name *perma*link.

Permalinks help to create a URL structure that is easy for both humans and search engines to understand and share.

- A permalink is used when another blogger wants to link to your article.
- You share the permalink when you want to share your content on social media.
- When Google wants to index your article, they use the permalink of the content.
- When you want to share a blog post with your friend, you send the permalink of your content in an email.

## Permalink Types

There are three types of WordPress permalinks:

### **Plain Permalinks**

The default Plain Permalink also called the Ugly Permalink looks like this:

http://example.com/?p=N

with p as the parameter and N is the unique ID of the post or page in the database.

WordPress comes preinstalled with this setting. It works on all server environments. It is not user-friendly and also not optimized for search engines.

### **Pretty Permalinks**

Pretty Permalinks are SEO-friendly and attractive. They usually contain several words such as the title of the post or page, post category, tag name, etc. You can use Keywords in the URL to make your content readable by search engines.

Pretty Permalinks also help others get an understanding of what the content of the page or post is by reading the URL.

Pretty Permalinks look like this:

http://example.com/2012/post-name/

or

http://example.com/2012/12/30/post-name

### **Almost Pretty Permalinks**

WordPress provides a third option called the Almost Pretty permalinks. These permalinks have /index.php prefixed before them, like so:

http://example.com/index.php/yyyy/mm/dd/post-name/

Except for this detail, they are similar to Pretty Permalinks.

## Choosing your permalink structure

On the WordPress dashboard, go to Settings â Permalinks Screen. You can choose one of the permalink structures or enter your own in the âCustom structureâ field using the *structure tags*.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Lcb0FZp6yKMbXUPN_IobSjNDSP3sl1IGphrkuwVdBzZ81rpigq04ewoiJd3drRIdEC_wrFjfV-smOvngr9enVzmff0eAdg2IeFPbMaHRT_I_AwUxNo5DfE_nyZPqqq-RHZu-BgLq)There are six options to select from:

Plain: This is the Ugly Permalink setting.

Day and name: This uses a year/month/date format followed by your post name.

Month and name: This uses a year/month format followed by your post name.

Numeric: This option uses the ID of the post from the row in the wp\_posts table of your database.

Post name: This one uses the name of your post.

Custom Structure: This field allows you to define your own custom URL structure using the structure tags available in WordPress.

The default setting is Plain, which is automatically configured when you install WordPress.

**NOTE:**  
Your hosting provider should have set up the web servers with the necessary configurations for the Pretty and Almost Pretty Permalinks to work correctly. If they are not, then you need to contact your hosting provider.

### **Structure Tags**

WordPress provides the following structure tags for creating your own custom permalinks. You can use these tags to customize your Pretty or Almost Pretty permalinks.

**Note:**

- You do not put your website URL in the permalinks fields. You only use one of the structure tags or a combination of tags.
- To use the Almost Pretty Permalinks, start your permalink structure with index.php/.
- End your structure with either %post\_id% or %postname% so that WordPress can target an individual post for every permalink. (E.g. /%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/)

**%year%**

The year of the post in four digits, eg: 2018

**%monthnum%**

Month the post was published, in two digits, eg: 05

**%day%**

Day the post was published in two digits, eg: 28

**%hour%**

Hour of the day, the post was published, eg: 15

**%minute%**

Minute of the hour, the post was published, eg: 43

**%second%**

Second of the minute, the post was published, eg: 33

**%post\_id%**

The unique ID of the post, eg: 423

**%postname%**

A sanitized version of the title of the post (*post slug* field on Edit Post/Page panel).

Eg: âThis Is A Great Post!â becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.

**%category%**

A sanitized version of the category name (*category slug* field on New/Edit Category panel).

Nested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI.

**%author%**

A sanitized version of the post authorâs name.

### **Category base and Tag base**

You also have the option of setting custom category and tag bases for your site on the same screen under the **Optional** settings section.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/T1ebzj_2xkBSUS9rNTXkrnIB_hB84Mc3MxCy2Sl82jesIPUO48GomcQzVfF5s-oVfABCm19HZsVvfUCBrBrUXVrDeolsyWvx1N2mFWaAeHCUy0J7ZG-OtXZuApJ8yFwZ09hr7-hV)The *Category base* and *Tag base* are prefixes used in URLs for category and tag archives, which look like this:

example.net/category\_base/category\_name

example.net/tag\_base/tag\_name

The default values for *Category base* and *Tag base* are category and tag. You can change them, but you canât remove them from the URLs altogether.

### **Using %category% with multiple categories on a post**

When you assign multiple categories to a post, only one can show up in the permalink. Which category gets displayed in the permalink is determined alphabetically.

If you want to choose which category shows up in the permalink, you can use one of the plugins from the [plugin directory](#plugins/search/taxonomy).

## Administration

### Can my posts have URL instead of /index.php?p=76?

See:

- [Using Permalinks](/support/article/using-permalinks/)

### How long is the release cycle of WordPress?

A major release of WordPress happens every 6 months or so. Suggest and vote on ideas for future releases at [the WordPress Extend Ideas site](#ideas).

Also refer [WordPress Versions](<https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress Versions>) for the chronologically listed versions of WordPress along with the Change Log information on new features and improvements in each version. There are the future releases and links to their respective milestones in the bug tracker.

### How do I turn on Permalinks, and what do I do about the errors?

See:

- [Using Permalinks](/support/article/using-permalinks/)

### What are Roles for and what permissions do different Roles have?

See:

- [Roles and Capabilities](#documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities)

### Why canât I delete the *uncategorized* Category?

Deleting a category does not delete the posts in that category. Instead, posts that were only assigned to the deleted category are set to the *uncategorized* category. Also, **all** [Pages](/support/article/pages/) are assigned the *uncategorized* Category.

The *uncategorized* category cannot be deleted, however you can specify your default categories for posts on the *Settings* â *Writing* screen of the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/).

### Why is there no Page Template option when writing or editing a Page?

If there is no Page Template option when writing or editing a [Page](/support/article/pages/) it may because there is no [template file](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Stepping Into Templates>) with the proper structure. For the Page Template box to be available to assign to a [Page](/support/article/pages/) there must be a least one template file in your theme that has a structure at the beginning of the template file that looks like this:

```
<?php
/*
Template Name: My Custom Page
*/
?>
```

Create a new PHP file with any name under the theme directory and put above codes into the file. You will see the Page Template box appears that includes âMy Custom Pageâ option in the Page Edit Screen. For more detail about Custom Page Template, refer [Page Templates](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Page Templates>).

### How do I determine a Post, Page, Category, Tag, or User ID?

Sometimes it is necessary to know the ID of a particular Post, Page, Category, Tag, or User. To determine that ID, use one of these method:

- Look in your browser status bar for the ID: 
    1. Visit the related list table screen in your Administration Screen. For instance in the case of Posts visit Posts-&gt;All Posts, for Pages visit Pages-&gt;All Pages, and for Categories visit Posts-&gt;Categories.
    2. Now hover your mouse over the âitemâ you need the ID. In the case of Pages, hover over that particular Pageâs title in the Title column and for Categories hover over the Categories Name in the Name column.
    3. Look at the status bar (at the bottom of your browser) and the you will find at the end of the line something like âpost=123â or âtag\_ID=67â. In these cases, 123 is the Page ID, and 67 is the Category ID.

## Configuration

### How can I change how the date and / or time is displayed?

See:

- [Formatting Date and Time](/support/article/formatting-date-and-time/)

### How can I control comments people make?

See:

- [Comment Moderation](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment Moderation>)

### What do the Discussion Options mean?

See:

- [Discussion Screen](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/)

### How do I install plugins?

See:

- [Managing Plugins](/support/article/managing-plugins/)

### Why are all the comments being moderated?

Go to the [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) &gt; [Discussion](/support/article/administration-screens/#discussion) screen and make sure that **Comment must be manually approved** is unchecked. With that option selected, all comments are sent to the moderation queue to await approval.  
Make sure that **Hold a comment in the queue if it contains x or more links.** is not blank and contains a number higher than zero. If this value is blank or zero, all comments containing links will be moderated.  
If the option mentioned above is unchecked, the link moderation value is higher than zero, and you still have this problem, then upgrade the comment spam plugins you have installed. If this continues to be a problem, deactivate the comment spam plugins one by one to determine the culprit and contact the plugin author for help.

### How do I disable comments?

First, uncheck **Allow people to post comments on new articles** on the [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) &gt; [Discussion](/support/article/administration-screens/#discussion) screen. This will only disable comments on *future posts*.  
Next, to completely disable comments, you will have to edit each past post and uncheck **Allow Comments** from the [Edit Post](/support/article/writing-posts/) screen. Use Bulk Edit to disable multiple posts at once.

1. In the [Posts\_Screen](/support/article/posts-screen/), check the checkbox in the Tableâs title to select all Posts in a given table.
2. From Bulk Actions box, select Edit and click Apply.
3. In the Bulk Edit Screen, select Do not allow option from Comments box
4. Click Update.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/12/posts-bulk-edit-screen-1024x506.jpg)Alternatively, you could run below MySQL query from the command line on a shell account or using [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/), or through a [wp-cli](https://codex.wordpress.org/wp-cli) `wp db query`:

```
UPDATE wp_posts SET comment_status = 'closed';
```

If your goal is to permanently remove comments, then follow the next steps. This is the example of [Twenty Fifteen](/support/article/twenty-fifteen/) theme customization.

1. Create a [Child Themes](<https://codex.wordpress.org/Child Themes>) of [Twenty Fifteen](/support/article/twenty-fifteen/) theme.
2. Copy `twentyfifteen_entry_meta()` function from parentâs `inc/template-tags.php` to child themeâs `functions.php`.
3. Comment out the if block that contains `comments-link`.

```
function twentyfifteen_entry_meta() {
    if ( is_sticky() && is_home() && ! is_paged() ) {
        :
    }

    // if ( ! is_single() && ! post_password_required() && ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) ) {
    //  echo '';
    //  /* translators: %s: post title */
    //  comments_popup_link( sprintf( __( 'Leave a comment on %s', 'twentyfifteen' ), get_the_title() ) );
    //  echo '';
    // }
}
```

It removes the number of comments or âLeave a commentâ message from bottom of each post.

1. Newly create `comments.php` under the Child Themeâs directory without any contents. It removes the comment area of exsiting posts.
2. Activate the Child Teheme.

### How do I disable trackbacks and pingbacks?

First, uncheck **Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles** on the [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) &gt; [Discussion](/support/article/administration-screens/#discussion) screen. This will only disable trackbacks and pingbacks on *future posts*.  
Next, to completely disable trackbacks and pingbacks, you will have to edit each past post and uncheck **Allow trackbacks and pingbacks on this page** from the [Edit Post](/support/article/writing-posts/) screen. Use Bulk Edit to disable multiple posts at once. See also above image.

1. In the [Posts\_Screen](/support/article/posts-screen/), check the checkbox in the Tableâs title to select all Posts in a given table.
2. From Bulk Actions box, select Edit and click Apply.
3. In the Bulk Edit Screen, select Do not allow option from Pings box.
4. Click Update.

Alternatively, you could run this MySQL query from the command line on a shell account or using [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/), or through a [wp-cli](https://codex.wordpress.org/wp-cli) `wp db query`:

```
UPDATE wp_posts SET ping_status = 'closed';
```

### How do I change the *site admin* name?

To change your Admin Name, in the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/), choose the **Users-&gt;Your Profile** menu. Make your changes there. However, you are not able to change the username from within the Administration screen. In order to do this you must directly edit the MySQL database, however this is not recommended as your username is not often seen by other users.

See:

- [Users Your Profile Screen](/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/)

### How do I find the absolute path I need for uploading images?

1. Open the below page from your Browser

```
http://(site URL)/wp-admin/options.php
```

1. Refer `upload_url_path` option value.  
    If the value is blank, then the directory `wp-content/upload` is the default destination to save.

### Which files do I change to alter the way my blog looks?

See:

- [Theme Development Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/)

### How do I upload images?

See:

- [Inserting Media into Posts and Pages](/support/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages/)

### Can I change the âError establishing database connectionâ message to something more descriptive?

Just simply create a file to reside at *wp-content/db-error.php*, and in that file put the message you want displayed to users when WordPress determines the database connection is not available. That file will be used in place of âError establishing database connectionâ message. You could even use the *db-error.php* to redirect users elsewhere. Hereâs an example for *db-error.php*:

```
<?php
echo '<h2> This site is currently experiencing a problem with the database server.</h2>  Press your browser Reload button to try again!';
?>
```

See:

- [Add an image to your RSS 2.0 feed at wordlog.com](http://wordlog.com/archives/2004/08/01/add-an-image-to-your-rss-20-field/)

### If I turn off comments, it says âComments Offâ on the weblog. so how do I remove that?

Depending on your theme, some other message of similar intent may be displayed. The specifics of how to remove this message is theme dependent. You should be able to find the offending text in your themeâs `comments.php` file. If itâs displayed by a PHP function, comment out the function with slash-asterisks â`/*`â and â`*/`â *(without quotes)* on either end of the function:

```
<?php /* _e( 'Comments are closed.' , 'twentytwelve' ); */ ?>
```

If itâs simply HTML, comment out the enclosing HTML tags by adding â`&lt;!-- `â and â` --&gt;`â *(not including the quotes, note the space after the first and before the last comment symbols)*:

```
<!-- <p class="nocomments">Comments are closed.</p> -->
```

If you decide later to restore the message, you can simply remove the comment symbols.

### How do I change what is shown when I password protect a post?

Hook the filters â`the_title`â and â`the_password_form`â. Your filter function is passed exactly what the filter names imply. Use the `str_replace()` function to search out the offending text and replace it with your preference (or nothing).  
Note the â`the_title`â filter fires for every single title, not just password protected posts, so you need to use the existence of the `post_password` property to know whether to apply the string replace function or not.  
Some themes may also have additional locations where content needs to be canged. Next example works with [Twenty Fifteen](/support/article/twenty-fifteen/) Theme.

```
add_filter('the_title', 'replace_protected', 10, 2);
function replace_protected( $title, $id ) {
    $post = get_post( $id );
    if ( ! empty( $post->post_password ) ) {
        $title = str_replace('Protected:', 'Hidden:', $title);
    }
    return $title;
}
add_filter('the_password_form', 'replace_message');
function replace_message( $form ) {
    return str_replace('This post is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:',
        'Enter you password below to see the surprise:', $form);
}
```

### How can I allow certain HTML tags in my comments?

Use a custom filter in your themes `functions.php` or plugin:

```
add_filter('preprocess_comment','fa_allow_tags_in_comments');

function fa_allow_tags_in_comments($data) {
    global $allowedtags;
    $allowedtags['span'] = array('style'=>array());
    $allowedtags['p'] = array();
    return $data;
}
```

## Importing and Exporting

### How do I Import a WordPress WXR file when it says it is too large to import?

If a WordPress WXR file, an XML file exported from WordPress, is too large to import, there are several things you might try to overcome that limit.

- Edit *php.ini*â. Some hosts may not allow this settings.

```
memory_limit = 300M
post_max_size = 200M
upload_max_filesize = 100M
max_execution_time = 600
```

- memory\_limit: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that a PHP script is allowed to allocate.

**Note:** memory\_limit should be larger than post\_max\_size, and post\_max\_size must be larger than upload\_max\_filesize.

- Edit *.htaccess*. Some hosts may not allow this settings.

```
php_value memory_limit 300M
php_value post_max_size 200M
php_value upload_max_filesize 100M
```

- Edit *wp-config.php*

```
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '64MB');
```

See also [Increasing memory allocated to PHP](/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/#increasing-memory-allocated-to-php).

- In multisite environment, configure following settings 
    1. From Network Admin dashboard, select Settings &gt; Network Settings and increase the values of âSite upload spaceâ and âMax upload file sizeâ.
    2. From Network Admin dashboard, select Sites &gt; All Sites and click Edit menu under your site. Click Settings tab and incease the value of âSite Upload Space Quotaâ or leave it blank for network default
- GZip the file. On some hosting services, a gzipped file can be automatically expanded in the background, without WordPress ever knowing the difference. This can allow you to make the file small enough to be fit into the maximum upload size constraints. 
    1. On Windows, use 7Zip to create a gz archive out of the WXR file.
    2. On Linux, use the gzip command line.
    3. Make sure that the resulting file has the file extension of â.gzâ before uploading it, as this is often necessary.
    4. This is not guaranteed to work, as it highly depends on the hosting configuration. If this fails, then try another method instead.
- Break the WordPress WXR file into smaller pieces by separating the data between posts and pasting the header/footer into each file.

1\. Always have the header

```
<rss version="2.0"
    xmlns:excerpt="https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/excerpt/"
    xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"
    xmlns:wfw="http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:wp="https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/"
>
<channel>
including all info like category, tags, etc to just before the first
```

2\. Always have the footer

```
</channel>
</rss>
```

3\. In between, add the posts start with end with and check to see whether the XML file youâre creating is less than or equal to 2MB. Youâll get the hang of it.

4\. As always, before importing the new XMLâs, backup the database of the blog you are importing the XML files to and might as well export XML file of that blog as well for good measure.

# WordPress Privacy <a name="documentation/article/wordpress-privacy" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-privacy/

## User Privacy and your WordPress site

Depending on your national or international privacy regulations (such as the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation which may be applicable to you) you may be required to display a privacy policy disclosing your collection and sharing of personal data. Personal data includes things like your usersâ name, email, birthdate, phone number, IP address and other data that can be used to identify them.

You may also be required to provide your users with the means to request a copy of the information you hold about them, or request its deletion.

WordPress now includes several simple tools for site administrators to take these steps. These tools make it easier for you to inform your users through a transparent privacy notice about data that is collected on your site. It usually includes at least:

- What data you collect about them,
- Why and how you collect data,
- And what you do with that data (including with whom who you might share that data).

These new tools also make it easier for users to request a copy of their data or its removal. The use of the new data privacy tools (whether required by law or not) will make it easier for you to protect your usersâ privacy.

Please note: Every website is different. No two privacy notices will be alike, just as no two site administrators will have identical compliance journeys. Additionally, new regulations, as well as adaptations of existing ones, may alter your compliance journeys. **We strongly encourage you to consider that safeguarding privacy is not a one-time responsibility.** Taking steps to secure and protect your usersâ data is a continuous process both online and offline. These tools can help you with parts of that process, but they are not a compliance process in and of itself. *We strongly encourage you to check the regulations and expectations applicable to you and adjust your usage of these tools as needed.*

## Privacy Settings

This tool makes it easier to select and build a Privacy Policy page. It will create a dedicated page (or adapt an existing one) and provide prompts and headers to kickstart the process.

Site administrators can create this page by going to *Settings &gt; Privacy*, where the Privacy Policy page setting is managed.

The prompts and headers provided in the tool by default are based on the expectations of Europeâs GDPR as a leading privacy standard. While this gives you a start to build on, your privacy policy is not constrained by this starter text. *It is your responsibility* to write a comprehensive privacy policy, to ensure that it reflects all national and international legal requirements on privacy, and to keep your policy current and accurate.

### Privacy Policy Editing Helper

The *Editing Helper* feature is part of the new *Privacy Settings* tool. Drawing information from both WordPress core and a siteâs themes and plugins, the Editing Helper pulls together a collected set of default texts which detail a siteâs data collection and sharing, generating a starter text which you can use to complete your privacy policy.

While you do not necessarily need to use this tool to build a Privacy Policy, we believe it is helpful because it provides information on how your WordPress site likely collects and processes data in core, theme and plugin code. It is important to consider these back-end uses of data: While not all sites will use all functions (for example, an administrator may choose not to enable comments on posts) nearly every site uses features such as analytics cookies, social media sharing buttons, or contact form plugins. Please add as many additional disclosures as is necessary to be fully transparent about how your site uses personal data.

*This tool ONLY collects policy help texts from WordPress and participating plugins.* Many sites will also embed third-party tools (such as email subscription services) which collect data in ways the the Editing Helper tool cannot detect, so the default template may not completely describe how your site might collect data about its user. Take the time to understand how your website actually collects your usersâ data, and be transparent about what actually happens with data on your website to your users.

Further, theme and plugin developers are invited to learn how the Privacy Policy Editing Helper works, and to feed in the information about how your theme or plugin collects data into the privacy policy tool.

## Export Personal Data tool

WordPress now includes a feature to to archive user data for export. This is different from the *Tools &gt; Export* tool which creates an archive file of posts, pages, or media; the new tool exports in captured elsewhere. You can use this tool by clicking on *Tools &gt; Export Personal Data* in your WordPress dashboard.

This tool manages email export requests by your users. Following manual approval, it allows you to generate a (`.zip`format) file containing the personal data which exists about a user within your WordPress site.

*We strongly encourage you use the email validation feature built into the export tools. This confirmation process will help safeguard against abuse, such as malicious users pretending to be someone they are not.* As with the Erasure tool, the Erase Personal Data tool uses email validation to send a userâs request to an administrator. The administrator must manually approve the request to send the data in question to the user.

*As this tool ONLY gathers data from WordPress and participating plugins, you may need to go beyond to comply with export requests.* While it may give you a good start in providing your users with the information they have requested, every site administrator should understand what data they collect and process outside their WordPress site as a full site request may have more responsibility than simply using this export alone.

While this toolâs scope covers much of the scope of WordPress user data, it likely does not include information that may be collected by your site using a third-party service, such as an analytics provider, newsletter subscription service, ad affiliate partner or embedded media.

## Erase Personal Data tool

Similar to the Export Personal Data tool, WordPress now includes a tool to delete a userâs personal data upon verified request. You will find this feature under *Tools &gt; Erase Personal Data* in your WordPress dashboard.

*We strongly encourage you use the email validation feature built into the export tool. This confirmation process will help safeguard against abuse, such as malicious users pretending to be someone they are not.* As with the Export tool, the Erase Personal Data tool uses email validation to send a userâs request to an administrator. The administrator must manually approve the request to remove the data in question.

*Deleted data is permanently removed from the database.* Erasure requests cannot be reversed after they have been confirmed. Note that it does not remove the data from backups or archive files: When using the tool alongside automated backups or archives, we advise you to exercise caution when restoring user data from backups. When restoring an archived copy of your site, your requests for erasure should be respected.

*As this tool ONLY gathers data from WordPress and participating plugins, you may need to go beyond to comply with erasure requests.* While it may give you a good start in complying with your usersâ request to remvoe the information they have requested, every site administrator should understand what data they collect and process outside their WordPress site as a full site erasure request may have more responsibility than simply using this tool alone.

In particular (as with the Export tool) it likely does not include information that may be collected by your site using a third-party service, such as an analytics provider, newsletter subscription service, ad affiliate partner or embedded media.

*When erasing user data, this tool does not automatically delete registered users and their profile data.* Administrators should perform that step themselves after successfully erasing personal data for a registered user. User deletion is available for each user in the *Users* menu in the Dashboard.

*It is also important to understand that personal data deletion requests are not absolute.* A site administrator is not obliged to delete data that they may be required to keep for other legal or statutory reasons. For example, you may be required to keep sales records for a certain number of years for tax purposes. You may also wish to keep a userâs records for security purposes, for example, if there is an ongoing investigation into abuse. These situations should be handled internally.

## Consent of data collected

Under some privacy laws, you may also be required to have your usersâ active, clear, and unambiguous consent before collecting their personal data. Further, you may also be required to have your usersâ active, clear, and unambiguous consent before certain kinds of processing of personal data, if that processing isnât otherwise necessary for your site.

While WordPress.org does not yet have consent tools built, [there are various plugins available](#plugins/tags/gdpr) to help in collecting consent to be compliant with the May 2018 GDPR compliance deadline. In addition, WordPress Core intends to add additional tools for WordPress theme and plugin developers for consent management in WordPress Sites.

Some plugins, especially in the case of forms and email subscription services, suggest that you add a ârequiredâ consent field that says something like [*âI consent to my submitted data being collected and storedâ*](https://docs.gravityforms.com/wordpress-gravity-forms-and-gdpr-compliance/) if this is a requirement for your website.

# Roles and Capabilities <a name="documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/

WordPress uses a concept of [Roles](#roles), designed to give the [site](/support/article/glossary/#site) owner the ability to control what users can and cannot do within the site. A site owner can manage the user access to such tasks as [writing and editing posts](/support/article/writing-posts/), [creating Pages](/support/article/pages/), [creating categories](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel), [moderating comments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation), [managing plugins](/support/article/managing-plugins/), [managing themes](/support/article/using-themes/), and [managing other users](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Screen), by assigning a specific role to each of the users.

WordPress has six pre-defined roles: [Super Admin](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#super-admin), [Administrator](#administrator), [Editor](#editor), [Author](#author), [Contributor](#contributor) and [Subscriber](#subscriber). Each role is allowed to perform a set of tasks called [Capabilities](/support/article/glossary/#capabilities). There are many capabilities including â[publish\_posts](#publish_posts)â, â[moderate\_comments](#moderate_comments)â, and â[edit\_users](#edit_users)â. [A default set](#capability-vs-role-table) of capabilities is pre-assigned to each role, but other capabilities can be assigned or removed using the [add\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_cap) and [remove\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_cap) functions. New roles can be introduced or removed using the [add\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_role) and [remove\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_role) functions.

The [Super Admin](#super-admin) role allows a user to perform all possible capabilities. Each of the other roles has a decreasing number of allowed capabilities. For instance, the [Subscriber](#subscriber) role has just the â[read](#read)â capability. One particular role should not be considered to be senior to another role. Rather, consider that roles define the userâs responsibilities within the site.

## Summary of Roles

- [Super Admin](#super-admin) â somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features. See the [Create a Network](/support/article/create-a-network/) article.
- [Administrator](#administrator) (*slug: âadministratorâ*) â somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.
- [Editor](#editor) (*slug: âeditorâ*) â somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.
- [Author](#author) (*slug: âauthorâ*) â somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.
- [Contributor](#contributor) (*slug: âcontributorâ*) â somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.
- [Subscriber](#subscriber) (*slug: âsubscriberâ*) â somebody who can only manage their profile.

Upon installing WordPress, an Administrator account is automatically created.

The default role for new users can be set in [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) &gt; [General](/support/article/settings-general-screen/).

## Roles

A Role defines a set of tasks a user assigned the role is allowed to perform. For instance, the [Super Admin](#super-admin) role encompasses every possible task that can be performed within a [Network](/support/article/glossary/#network) of virtual WordPress [sites](/support/article/glossary/#site). The [Administrator](#administrator) role limits the allowed tasks only to those which affect a single site. On the other hand, the [Author](#author) role allows the execution of just a small subset of tasks.

The following sections list the default Roles and their capabilities:

### Super Admin

Multisite Super Admins have, by default, all capabilities. The following Multisite-only capabilities are therefore only available to Super Admins:

- [create\_sites](#create_sites)

- [manage\_network\_options](#manage_network_options)
- [upgrade\_network](#upgrade_network)
- [setup\_network](#setup_network)

In the case of single site WordPress installation, Administrators are, in effect, Super Admins. As such, they are the only ones to have access to [additional admin capabilities](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#additional-admin-capabilities).

### Special Cases

The following capabilities are special cases:

- [unfiltered\_upload](#unfiltered_upload) â This capability is not available to any role by default (including Super Admins). The capability needs to be enabled by defining the following constant:

```
define( 'ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS', true );
```

With this constant defined, all roles on a single site install can be given the unfiltered\_upload capability, but only Super Admins can be given the capability on a Multisite install.

# What&#8217;s the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com? <a name="documentation/article/difference-between-wordpress-org-and-wordpress-com" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/difference-between-wordpress-org-and-wordpress-com/

## WordPress vs. WordPress.com

People are often confused about the differences between WordPress and WordPress.com. WordPress is the free, Open Source web publishing software project, owned by no one individual or company. WordPress.com is a hosted blogging service run by a company called [Automattic](https://automattic.com/).

## WordPress

WordPress (sometimes called âWordPress.orgâ or âself-hosted WordPressâ for disambiguation purposes), is software that you can download and install on any web host. It began in 2003 as a fork of b2/cafelog. Licensed by the GPL, you are free to use WordPress without restriction. Sites powered by WordPress may have a âProudly powered by WordPressâ credit, or they may have no credit at all. The absence of any mention of âWordPress.comâ is a good indicator that it is a self-hosted WordPress instance).

## WordPress.com

WordPress.com (a.k.a. âwpcomâ or âWP.comâ) is a for-profit hosted blogging service run by Automattic. WordPress.com launched in 2005, and is the largest WordPress install in the world. It is powered by WordPress, with some additional plugins and modifications layered on. Having â.wordpress.comâ in the domain of the blog or the presence of a âBlog at WordPress.comâ promo message or credits image can be used to determine whether a site is hosted at WordPress.com.

## Overlap

What is the overlap between WordPress and WordPress.com? First, Matt Mullenweg is both CEO of Automattic, and co-founder of WordPress. Matt is involved with both WordPress and WordPress.com. Some WordPress contributors are also employees of Automattic. There are many more WordPress contributors, most of which have no connection with WordPress.com.

Development decisions about WordPress are made without specific regard to their impact on WordPress.com. Any special changes that WordPress.com needs are made on that side, by Automattic employees.

## Additional resource

This video is an overview of the differences between WordPress and WordPress.com:

See more here: <https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/what-is-the-difference-between-wordpress-org-and-com/>## FAQ

**Automatticâs relationship to WordPress?**

Automattic uses WordPress to power WordPress.com, and it contributes back code and time to the WordPress project. It is a symbiotic relationship. It isnât accurate to say that WordPress is Automatticâs product, or that WordPress came from Automattic. Indeed, the opposite is true â Automattic came from WordPress, and Automattic (through WordPress.com) exists as part of the vast WordPress community and ecosystem.

**Why canât I call WordPress.com just âWordPressâ?**

Because it isnât clear what youâre talking about â the Open Source project, or the hosted blogging service. They are distinct, and statements about one arenât necessarily true about the other. WordPress.com is its name. You wouldnât call bit.ly, the popular link shortening service, just âbit,â would you?

**Why doesnât Automattic rename WordPress.com to something more distinct?**

WordPress.com offers [multi-site](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/) for free and on very inexpensive plans, has never had any downtime or lost user data since 2005, and has onboarded and introduced hundreds of millions of people to WordPress. Their higher-tier plans offer some of the fastest and most secure WordPress Managed Hosting available anywhere, with full plugin and theme support. That advanced managed platform is now licensed to other hosts [through wp.cloud](https://wp.cloud/) and is raising the bar for the industry. The flavor of WordPress offered by WordPress.com is a huge asset to the brand and adoption of WordPress overall.

## I have done the 5-minute installation. Now what?

Youâve just completed the [5-Minute Installation](/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/) of WordPress or the one-click install from your web host. So what is your next step?

Letâs take a step-by-step tour through your WordPress site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please *donât change anything within the program* unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, youâll soon be changing everything.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2020-12-31-at-3.22.22-PM-920x1024.png)

Begin by logging into the administration area, or the [back end](/support/article/glossary/#back-end), of your website. Visit your siteâs login page by placing *wp-admin* after your domain name (e.g., http://example.com/wp-admin). Some [themes](/support/article/using-themes/) provide a login link or form on the [front end](/support/article/glossary/#front-end) as well. Now login to WordPress using the username and password you created in the 5-minute install.

### Start at the top

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1024x583.png)After logging in you are on the main [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/) called the [Dashboard](/support/article/glossary/#dashboard). This is where the organization of your site begins.

At the top of the screen is the area called the [*toolbar*](/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together). Click on your site name; itâs a link and it will take you to a view of your new WordPress site. Like it? Donât like it? Doesnât matter, just look at it. This is where you are going to be spending a lot of time!

## Test drive your WordPress site

Take time to look at the site before you get into changing it and figuring out [how it all works](https://codex.wordpress.org/Working_with_WordPress); itâs important to see how the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme is laid out and how it works. Consider this the test drive before you start adding all the special features.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/myfirstwpsite-â-Just-another-WordPress-site-1024x838.png)The layout you are looking at is defined by a [WordPress Theme](/support/article/using-themes/). It is the [appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) of your website, styling the look of the site, and the framing of the content. The WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme features a âheaderâ at the top with the title and tagline for your site. Below is your [Menu](/support/article/appearance-menus-screen/), if you have one. The main middle section of the page is the content area.

Scroll down the page and you will see a search box, recent posts, and recent comments. These are called [Widgets](/support/article/wordpress-widgets/).

Notice the bar at the end of the page. This is called the âfooter.â It says âProudly powered by WordPress.â

### Take a Quick Trip Around

For now, you only have one post. It is residing within a page that is laid out as your *home page* or the front page. If you click on the title of the post, it will take you to the specific page for that post. The first page or home page of your site features the most recent posts on your site. Each post title will link to the actual page of the post. Some Theme designers design their *single* post pages to look different from the home page.

In the single post, pay attention to the layout and notice what is different about the design elements. Is the header different? Smaller, larger, or a different color? Is there a sidebar?

All of these changes are created from a few files called [template files](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/). You can learn more about how they work in [Theme Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/). For now, however, letâs get on with how the rest of WordPress works.

## Test Drive the WordPress Administration Screens

Now that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, itâs time to test drive the [WordPress Administration](#documentation/article/administering-your-blog). This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the [Dashboard](/support/article/glossary/#dashboard), a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/wordpress-6-0-dashboard-1024x583.png)The [Dashboard](/support/article/glossary/#dashboard) features a list of the most recent activity youâve accomplished on your site and it helps to keep you up to date on new and interesting bits of information from the many WordPress resources.

On the left side of the screen is the **main navigation** menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will âfly outâ for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a âparentâ navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section.

The various menu items are as follows:

- [Dashboard](/support/article/administration-screens/#dashboard-information-central)
- [Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content)
- [Media](/support/article/administration-screens/#media-add-pictures-and-movies-to-your-posts)
- [Pages](/support/article/administration-screens/#pages-your-static-content)
- [Comments](/support/article/administration-screens/#comments-reader-feedback)
- [Appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog)
- [Plugins](/support/article/administration-screens/#plugins-add-functionality-to-your-blog)
- [Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#users-your-blogging-family)
- [Tools](/support/article/administration-screens/#tools-managing-your-blog)
- [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings)

### Letâs start with the User screen

Click on the **Users** tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called [All Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#all-users) that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authorsâ accounts. In the navigation menu, click on the Your Profile menu choice. This is where you will enter information about yourself, the author, and the [administrator](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#administrator) of the site. Fill in the information and click **Update Profile** when done.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Profile-â¹-myfirstwpsite-â-WordPress-1024x472.png)Now, letâs look at some other powerful features of the WordPress Admin.

### Changing the Look

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/Manage-Themes-â¹-myfirstwpsite-â-WordPress-1024x615.png)  
 The [Appearance, Themes Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) allows you to change the look of your site using different [Themes](/support/article/using-themes/). Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from. In your Appearance Screen, you will see a list of currently installed themes, including the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme. To quickly change the theme, simply click on the Activate button under one of the themes listed, then click on your site name in the top [toolbar](/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together) to see how it looks. Wow, you have another look. Itâs that easy. Go back to **Appearance &gt; Theme** and click the Activate button under the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme to bring the design back to what you had. To see it again, click your site name in the toolbar, and there it is.

![First time opening "Create a post" screen with welcome wizard. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626067-55fd593f-e477-479a-893d-495b84e6d67f-1024x612.jpg)### Creating a post

Back in the [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/), take a look at the [Posts Screen](/support/article/administration-screens#all-posts). You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to [write and manage your posts](/support/article/wordpress-editor/). Letâs start by making your first test post in the [Add New](/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content) tab.

The first time you use the Block Editor, you will see a short tutorial.

![Edit post screen without any content.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626066-e87b562b-4522-4105-bb27-5f1c58d5d31e-1024x612.png)Add the title of the article in the space allocated. Then write a text in the â*Start writing or type / to choose a block*â section. This is just for a test, so you can write anything you want. When you are done, click on the **Publish** button at the top right of the page, then click a second time to confirm the publication. Now that youâve gotten a feel for writing posts, you can view your posts by clicking your site name in the [toolbar](/support/article/administration-screens#toolbar) at top of the screen.

### Comments

Part of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. Do you want comments on your posts? Comments on posts come in a variety of forms, from *pats on the back* (*Good job! Like the post!*) to extensive conversations and commentary about the posts. Or maybe you are seeking comments that add to the information youâve posted. Responding to comments and [moderating them](/support/article/comments-in-wordpress/) can also take up a lot of time. If they are critical to your site, then include them and consider how you want them presented. You can make a few comments yourself on the post you created. Take a look at how they are laid out and consider how you might want them to look to fit into the design and layout of your site. When you have reached your decision about how you want to handle comments, take time to read through the [article on comments and WordPress discussion options](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) to help you set those features.

#### Preventing Spam

There is more to think about when it comes to having comments on your site. Unfortunately, we live in a world where [spam](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam) is a fact of life. It is recommended that you begin battling the comment spammers with the helpful article, [Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam](/support/article/comment-spam/).

### Create Categories

Posts are usually stored in Categories and/or Tags so you can keep related topics together. Right now you only have one category, but you will soon want more. In the **[Posts &gt; Categories](/support/article/administration-screens/#categories)** tab, in the **Add New Category** area, fill in the information about your category. Continue to add your *parent* categories, going down the list. Hold off on entering subcategories until all the main categories are entered.

**NOTE:** *You can add any new category at any time, but make a note of the fact that categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult to change this, so if you donât want your categories sorted alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them presented on the screen.*

## Setting Up Your Site

Before you get to the graphic look of your site, letâs do a little more administration to your site to set it up. You may want to install plugins to supercharge your website, and donât forget to activate the [Akismet WordPress Plugin](#plugins/akismet) that is available with all WordPress sites to help protect it from comment spam. When you have the parent categories entered, enter your subcategories. In the pull-down menu for Parent Category, you can select the *parent* to the subcategory you are adding. When you view your categories in the Manage &gt; Categories Screen, you will see the categories listed like this:

- Computer Tips 
    - Windows
    - Linux
    - Mac
- Internet News
- Web Page Design 
    - Web Standards
- WordPress 
    - Plugins
    - Themes

### Put Posts in Categories

Letâs put some of your test posts into categories so you can see how this works. From the **Posts &gt; Category Screen**, click on the tab for **[All Posts](/support/article/administration-screens/#all-posts)**. You should see the test posts you entered here. When you hover your mouse over each post title, under the title, you should see the Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View links. Click on Edit to edit one of the posts. On the right side of the Edit Post screen, you will now see your Categories. Choose one of them by clicking on the box next to it. Then in the Publish module above, click the **Update** button. Repeat this for your other test posts, putting each one in a different category. Now view your page by clicking on your site name in the [toolbar](/support/article/administration-screens/#toolbar-keeping-it-all-together) at the top of your [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/). Do you see the categories listed in the sidebar now? Great. If you are missing a category, that usually means that there are no posts in it. This is the default function of WordPress, so not to worry. When you add a post to the âmissingâ category, it will appear on your web pages. Click on one of the categories and you will be taken to a page for just that category. You should see the posts that went into that category. This is a generated *Category* page. Now, click on the **Archives** for the month showing. Now you are visiting a generated page of your posts listed in chronological order for this month â well, specifically for today only. Two methods of finding the same information.

### What Is Next

Youâve now done all the basics for your new WordPress website. You know how to write a post, create a category, and how to view your siteâs information by category and archive. You can start the customization process, and when you are done, donât forget to delete your test posts! Then start writing some wonderful information to share with your new-found public!

## Using WordPress Themes

There are hundreds of [WordPress Themes](/support/article/using-themes/) to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audienceâs needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above. Click through the whole site, the categories and archives as well as the individual posts to see how the Theme handles each one. The look may be nice on the front page, but if it handles things in a way you donât like on the single post, then you will have to dig into the code and make changes. Not ready for that, try another theme.

### Creating your own Theme

If you are familiar with CSS, HTML, and even PHP and MySQL, consider either customizing the Theme to your own needs or creating your own Theme.

## Using WordPress Plugins

![Plugins screen with two inactive default plugins.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/324626066-e87b562b-4522-4105-bb27-5f1c58d5d31e-1-1024x571.png)[WordPress Plugins](/support/article/plugins/) are also known as add-ons or extensions. They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. They cover the gamut from up-to-date weather reports to a simple organization of your posts and categories. Plugins are designed by volunteer contributors and enthusiasts who like challenges and problem-solving. They are usually fairly [simple to install](/support/article/managing-plugins/) through the WordPress Admin Plugin Screen, just follow the instructions provided by the plugin author. Remember, these are free and non-essential. If you have any problems with plugins, contact the plugin authorâs website or plugin source first, then search the Internet for help with that specific plugin, and if you havenât found a solution, then visit the WordPress forums for more help.

### Creating your own Plugin

If you are familiar with PHP, HTML, and maybe even MySQL, you may be able to customize WordPress to work the way you want by creating your own Plugin.

- [WordPress Plugin Developer Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/)

## Above and Beyond the Basics

The exciting thing about WordPress is that there are few limits. Thousands of people are using WordPress for blogging and for running their websites. For example, look at some of the entries under the [WordPress.org Theme Showcase](#showcase). All have a different look and different functions on their sites. What you do from here is up to you, but here are a few places to take that first step beyond the basics:

# What is an excerpt? (Block Editor) <a name="documentation/article/what-is-an-excerpt-block-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-is-an-excerpt-block-editor/

Note: This page uses Block Editor. If you are a Classic Editor User, refer [this page](/support/article/excerpt/).

## What is an Excerpt

Excerpt is an optional text associated to a Post. Most of the time, it is used as the **Post summary**.

![Gutenberg - Excerpt](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Gutenberg-Excerpt.png)WordPress excerpt metabox Canât find the Excerpt editing box? Check your **Document** tab at the right of your page. The Excerpt box is just after the Featured Image section.

Regarding the Theme you are using on your site, Excerpts can be displayed on different pages (search results, archives, etc.).

If Excerpt is empty, WordPress automatically creates an excerpt using the first 55 words of the post.

## How to display Excerpts on the Posts page

1. Go to **Settings &gt; Reading**.
2. Scroll to **For each article in a feed, show**.
3. Select **Summary**.

# Set blog content visibility (Block Editor) <a name="documentation/article/content-visibility-block-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/content-visibility-block-editor/

 Note: This page uses Block Editor. If you are a Classic Editor User, refer [this page](/support/article/content-visibility/).

Content visibility is about controlling who can see your blog content. WordPress allows you to control the visibility of your posts and [Pages](/support/article/pages/) on an individual basis. By default, all posts and Pages are visible.

There are several ways to set the visibility for your blog content. You can set it on a per post/Page basis for public, private, or Password Protected, or make the entire blog private and Password Protected through the use of WordPress Plugins.

## Setting Page and Post Visibility

The option is available in the **Document** tab on the right of the page under â**Status &amp; Visibility**â. The screenshot below shows the interface, with the relevant section highlighted in the red rectangle.

![Gutenberg - Content Visibility](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/12/Gutenberg-Content-Visibility-1024x522.png)The default state for post and Page visibility is **Public**. Public visibility means that the content will be visible to the outside world as soon as it is published.

By clicking on the edit link next to **Visibility: Public** in the Publish options, you can choose from an expanded selection of visibility options.

![Gutenberg - Content Visibility Selection](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/12/Gutenberg-Content-Visibility-Selection.png)

The options are:

- **Public:** The default, viewable to all.
- **Private:** This option hides the content from the public completely.
- **Password Protected:** Clicking this radio button followed by âOKâ causes a further text box to appear, into which you can enter a password.

### Password Protected Content

Password Protected content is not immediately visible to the outside world. Instead, visitors will see a prompt similar to this:

![Gutenberg - Content Visibility Protected](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/12/Gutenberg-Content-Visibility-Protected.png)The title for your protected entry is shown, along with a password prompt. A visitor to your site must enter the password in the box in order to see the content of the post or Page.

### Private Content

Private content is published only for your eyes, or the eyes of only those with authorization permission levels to see private content. Normal users and visitors will not be aware of private content. It will not appear in the article lists. If a visitor were to guess the URL for your private post, they would still not be able to see your content. You will only see the private content when you are logged into your WordPress blog.

![Gutenberg - Content Visibility Private](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Gutenberg-Content-Visibility-Private.png)

Once you change the visibility to private, the post or page status changes to âPrivately Publishedâ as shown. Private posts are automatically published but not visible to anyone but those with the appropriate permission levels (Editor or Administrator).

**WARNING:** If your site has multiple editors or administrators, they will be able to see your protected and private posts in the **Edit** screen. They do not need the password to be able to see your protected posts. They can see the private posts in the **Edit** Posts/Pages list, and are able to modify them, or even make them public. Consider these consequences before making such posts in such a multiple-user environment.

## Hiding The Entire WordPress Blog

Currently the functionality to hide your entire blog from public view, or to restrict it to certain users, is not part of the core WordPress product. There are possible plans to introduce this functionality into a later version.

There are various WordPress Plugins to restrict the visibility such as:

- [Page Restrict](#plugins/pagerestrict)
- [Force Login](#plugins/wp-force-login)
- [jonradio Private Site](#plugins/jonradio-private-site)

Alternatively, you could use the `.htaccess` to restrict who can visit your web site, but this is beyond the scope of this document.

# The WordPress Gallery (Block Editor) <a name="documentation/article/the-wordpress-gallery-block-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/the-wordpress-gallery-block-editor/

Note: This page uses Block Editor. If you are a Classic Editor User, refer [this page](/support/article/the-wordpress-gallery/).

## Overview

Image galleries are a great way to share groups of pictures on your WordPress site. The **Create Gallery** feature of the WordPress media uploader allows you to add a simple image gallery to pages or posts on your site.

[![A published gallery with captions](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/published-gallery.png?fit=710%2C686&ssl=1)](#documentation/files/2018/11/published-gallery.png)End result of published galleryThis article introduces how to add an image gallery using the media library.

## Adding image gallery using media library

Hereâs how to add an image gallery step-by-step, using the media uploader:

*Note: Before adding a gallery, you should be comfortable using the* Add media *feature and the media uploader to [add images to your media library and place them into posts](/support/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages/).*

### Step 1 â Place your cursor

A gallery can go anywhere on a page or post â by itself on a blank page, or above, below, or in the midst of text. Start by placing your cursor where you want the gallery to appear â if itâs in between blocks of text, like in the photo example below, consider adding a return and placing your cursor on a new line so thereâs space above and below.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Screenshot_24.png)   
Place cursor where gallery should be### Step 2 â Select the Gallery block

Once youâve placed your cursor where you want your image gallery to appear, click on the **+** symbol on the left of the cursor and select Gallery.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Gutenberg-Gallery-Block-1.png)### Step 3 â Add and/or Select the Images You Want to Include

You can add or select the images you want to include in your image gallery by choosing from either of the following options in the center of the media uploader window:

- **Upload Files:** Upload the images you want to use from your computer by dragging them into the upload area. You can add more than one image, and they will be automatically grouped together as an image gallery.
- **Media Library:** Select from previously uploaded images in the media library by clicking on the ones you wish to add to the gallery. You will see a checkbox next to your selections.

![](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Screenshot_25.png?fit=1024%2C514&ssl=1)Select the images you want to add from the media gallery*Note: You can create an image gallery using directly images from your computer simply by switching back and forth between the Upload Files and Media Library options.*

As you upload and/or select images, you will see your selection confirmed on the Insert Media screen by checkboxes at the top corner of each thumbnail. Also, a row of thumbnails appears at the bottom of the window to help you keep track of all the images youâve selected. When you are happy with your selection, click the **Create a new gallery** button.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Screenshot_25-1024x514.png)### Step 4 â Edit Your Gallery

On the Edit Gallery page, you can do the following things before inserting the gallery you have created into your page or post:

- **Rearrange your images:** Drag and Drop image thumbnails to rearrange the order of images in your gallery.
- **Reverse Order:** Reverses the order of the images in your gallery.
- **Add image descriptions:** Add descriptions to your images (optional) which appear as image captions below each thumbnail in the gallery.
- **Remove images:** Hover over a thumbnail and click on the âXâ to remove any of the images you previously selected.
- **Add more images:** Click on the âAdd to Galleryâ link in the left-hand sidebar and add or select the images you want to include in your image gallery by choosing from either âUpload Filesâ or âMedia Libraryâ tabs.
- **Cancel Gallery:** Click on the âCancel Galleryâ link from the actions on the left to exit the Edit Gallery page and cancel your image gallery.

![](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Screenshot_26.png?fit=1024%2C512&ssl=1)After inserting your gallery, you also have several Gallery Settings available in the right pane of your editor screen:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Screenshot_27.png)- **Links To:** Controls whether the gallery thumbnails (on the published page/post) link to the image attachment page or directly to the source image file itself.
- **Columns:** Set the number of columns you would like to have in your gallery. 3 Columns is the default settings, which is ideal for most sites.

### Editing Existing Galleries

Within the visual editor, the image gallery is displayed as a series of thumbnail images.

![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/05/Screenshot_29.png?fit=1024%2C522&ssl=1) Gallery in WordPress editorWhen you click any area of the image gallery, icon buttons appear top of the area. At any time, you can edit the images or settings of your gallery by clicking on the Edit button. You can remove the image gallery at any time by clicking on the Remove button.

# Inserting images into posts and pages (Block Editor) <a name="documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages-block-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages-block-editor/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

*Note: This page uses Block Editor. If you are a Classic Editor User, refer [this page](#documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages-classic).*

When creating or editing a WordPress page or blog post, you can easily add images to a post or page using the Image Block.

## Adding the Image Block to the Page or Post

To add an image to your page or post, youâll add an [Image Block.](#documentation/article/image-block)

You can also add an Image Block from within your content. To do that, hover over the block youâd like to add the Image Block above or below and click the plus sign. Then select the Image block from the available blocks shown.

![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Add-an-image-block.gif?fit=1024%2C560&ssl=1)Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).

Once youâve added the block, you will see the option to upload an image, select an image from the Media Library or insert an image from a URL.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-9.05.55-AM.png)## Adding the Image to the Block

There are four ways you can add an image to the block. Three offered via buttons on the Image block placeholder and one drag &amp; drop way to add images to your post or page.

1. **Upload from your computer**  
    Click on the âUploadâ button. This opens up a dialog box pointing to your own hard drive. Select the file you want to upload and click on the âOpenâ button.

2. **From the Media Library**  
    You can select an existing image from your Media Library by clicking the âMedia Libraryâ button.

3. **Insert from URL**   
    Click on the âInsert from URLâ button and paste or type in the URL for the image.   
    *Notes:* 
    1. URL needs to be a fully qualified URL starting with https:// and the domain name and not be a relative reference to your own site.
    2. Images inserted via URL, will not be saved into your Media Library. They keep referenceing the image from the site of the URL. If the site disappears, your image will disappear from your post or page*.*

4. **Drag &amp; Drop**   
    You can select an image from your Explorer or Finder window on your computer and drag it into the block editor window. then drag and drop it into the block.

## Block Toolbar

Besides the âMoverâ and âDrag &amp; Drop Handleâ on the left side, the Block Toolbar for the Image Block shows five buttons:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-11.17.28-AM.png)- Block Styles and Transform to

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-11.31.51-AM.png)

**Transform to**

You can transform an image block into five other blocks:

A Group block, a [Gallery](#documentation/article/gallery-block) block, a [Cover](#documentation/article/cover-block) block, a [File ](#documentation/article/file-block)block and a [Media &amp; Text ](#documentation/article/media-text-block)block. Please use the links to learn more about these blocks that use an image.

**Replace**

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-11.19.54-AM.png)The âReplaceâ button from the toolbar provides you with three choices to replace the existing image with another one: via the Media Library, Upload from your computer or Insert from URL. These are the same choices you encountered at the beginning of this article.

**Insert Link**

âInsert Linkâ Button allows you to add a link to your image. The link options are:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-11.20.03-AM.png)- **Paste URL** â Links to a website or a different post or page on your own site. Can be relative or absolute (â/contact-pageâ or âhttps://google.comâ). Type in a keyword and the Search will find a page/post from your own site.
- **Media File** â Links to a page with just the image
- **Attachment Page** â Links to the WordPress Attachment Page with details about the image

**More Options:**

The image block has a number of additional options that can be accessed clicking on the three-dot menu on the right hand-side part of the tool bar. These options are common to all blocks, you can read more about them [here](#documentation/article/more-options).

![How to access the "More Options" menu on the Image Block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/More-options-6-3-image-1024x972.png)## Block Settings

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-11.45.31-AM.png)When you add a new block to your post or page content, it automatically brings up the blockâs settings in the right-hand menu.

**Styles**

Image can be displayed two different styles.

The **âDefaultâ** style displays your image as it was uploaded.

The **âRoundedâ** style offers you a display with rounded corners

Via the **Default Style** drop-down you can select a default display variation.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Default-Styles.jpg)**Image Settings**

The Image settings include Alternative Text, Image Size, Image Dimensions, and Advanced.

The ***Alt Text*** setting is where you would add a description of the image for people who canât see it. This helps with accessibility as well as search engine optimization.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-3.14.37-PM.png)![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-3.16.29-PM-1.png)![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-3.38.05-PM-1.png)The ***Image Size*** setting allows you to select from Thumbnail, Medium, Large and Full Size.

- **Thumbnail:** Displays a small thumbnail-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note, by default the Thumbnail size is a square, so some cropping of your original image may occur.
- **Medium:** Displays a medium-sized version of your image on the page/post. This is a good size to use with Left/Right alignments, as it leaves sufficient space for legible text to either side.
- **Large**: Displays a large-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space.
- **Full Size:** Displays a full-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space. If your original image is larger than this column width, the full size of the image may not be displayed.

The ***Image Dimensions*** setting allows you to manually set a height and width or set the image to 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the imageâs full size. Thereâs also a Reset button there in case you need to revert your changes

**Advanced**

**Title attribute**

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-3.40.52-PM.png)Beyond the Alt-text, you can also add a title attribute for your image, describing briefly the role of this image on the page.

To learn more, [follow the link](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#the-title-attribute) to the explanation on W3.org, the standards body for HTML.

**Additional CSS class(es)**

In the âAdditional CSS class(es0 section you can one or more CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

[![](#documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-22-at-10.33.35-AM.png)](#documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-22-at-10.33.35-AM.png)The advanced section lets you add a CSS class to your block.### Image Caption

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-23-at-3.45.23-PM.png)Beneath the Image in the Image block, there is an option for you to add a caption. You can format the text in Bold, italics and add a link.

# WordPress Semantics <a name="documentation/article/wordpress-semantics" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-semantics/

## Terminology Introduction

The developers created WordPress as a **weblogging** ([blogging](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/)) system. A [blog](/support/article/glossary#blog), as defined in the [Codex Glossary](/support/article/glossary), is âan online journal, diary, or serial, published by a person or group of peopleâ. Many *blogs* are personal in nature, reflecting the opinions and interests of the owner. But, *blogs* are now important tools in the world of news, business, politics, and entertainment.

*Blogs* are a form of a [Content Management System (CMS)](/support/article/glossary#content-management-system), which [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) calls âa system used to organize and facilitate collaborative content creation.â Both *blogs* and *Content Management Systems* can perform the role of a [website](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) (**site** for short). A *website* can be thought of as a collection of articles and information about a specific subject, service, or product, which may not be a personal reflection of the owner. More recently, as the role of WordPress has expanded, WordPress developers have begun using the more general term **site**, in place of blog.

### Content Terminology

The term **Word** in WordPress refers to the words used to compose [posts](/support/article/glossary/#post). *Posts* are the principal element (or [content](/support/article/glossary#content)) of a blog. The *posts* are the writings, compositions, discussions, discourses, musings, and, yes, the rantings of the blogâs owner and guest authors. *Posts*, in most cases, are the reason a blog exists; without *posts*, there is no blog!

Integral to a blog are the pictures, images, sounds, and movies, otherwise know as [media](/support/article/media-library-screen/). *Media* enhances, and gives life to a blogâs content. WordPress provides an easy to use method of inserting *Media* directly into posts, and a method to [upload Media](https://codex.wordpress.org/Media_Add_New_SubPanel) that can be later attached to posts, and a [Media Library](/support/article/media-library-screen/) to manage those various *Media*.

An important part of the [posting](/support/article/writing-posts/) process is the act of assigning those posts to [categories](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel). Each post in WordPress is filed under one or more *categories*. *Categories* can be hierarchical in nature, where one category acts as a parent to several child, or grandchild, categories. Thoughtful *categorization* allows posts of similar content to be grouped, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation, and use of a site. In addition to categories, terms or keywords called [tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Tags_SubPanel) can be assigned to each post. *Tags* act as another navigation tool, but are not hierarchical in nature. Both categories and tags are part of a system called [taxonomies](/support/article/glossary#taxonomy). If categories and tags are not enough, users can also create [custom taxonomies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy) that allow more specific identification of posts or pages or [custom post types](/support/article/glossary#post-type).

In turn, post categories and tags are two of the elements of whatâs called [post meta data](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Meta_Data_Section). *Post meta data* refers to the information associated with each post and includes the authorâs name and the date posted as well as the post categories. *Post meta data* also refers to [Custom Fields](/support/article/custom-fields/) where you assign specific words, or keys, that can describe posts. But, you canât mention *post meta data* without discussing the term **meta**.

Generally, [meta](/support/article/glossary#meta) means **âinformation aboutâ**; in WordPress, *meta* usually refers to **administrative**-type information. So, besides *post meta data*, *Meta* is the [HTML](/support/article/glossary#html) tag used to describe and define a web page to the outside world, like *meta tag keywords* for search engines. Also, many WordPress-based sites offer a *Meta* section, usually found in the [sidebar](https://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_Your_Sidebar), with links to login or register at that site. And, donât forget [Meta Rules](https://codex.wordpress.org/Codex:Guidelines#Meta_Rules): The rules defining the general protocol to follow in using this Codex, or *Meta,* as in the [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) [namespace](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Namespace) that refers to administrative functions within Codex. Thatâs a lot of *Meta*!

After a post is made public, a blogâs readers will respond, via [comments](/support/article/glossary#comments), to that post, and in turn, authors will reply. *Comments* enable the communication process, that give-and-take, between author and reader. *Comments* are the life-blood of most blogs.

Finally, WordPress also offers two other [content management tools](/support/article/glossary#content-management-system) called [Pages](/support/article/pages) and [custom post types](/support/article/glossary#post-type). *Pages* often present static information, such as âAbout Meâ, or âContact Usâ, *Pages*. Typically âtimelessâ in nature, *Pages* should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called *posts*. Interestingly, a *Page* is allowed to be [commented upon](/support/article/glossary#comments), but a *Page* cannot be [categorized](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel). A [custom post type](/support/article/glossary#post-type) refers to a type of structured data that is different from a post or a page. Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things as portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and whatever a user or developer can imagine.

### Design Terminology 

A *WordPress Theme* is the overall design of a site and encompasses color, graphics, and text. A *Theme* is sometimes called the **skin** or template, but it isnât really. A skin and template are really website paint jobs. A WordPress Theme is where code meets design, allowing a site to change based upon specific conditions set by the site administrator.

Installation of WordPress Themes is made easy with the [Themes Menu](/support/article/administration-screens/#themes) on the Administration Screens. Simply search for a new Theme from within the [official WordPress Theme Directory](#themes) and activate it with a few clicks. You can also preview your site before installing and activating the Theme to see what your site will look like with that WordPress Theme.

The *flexibility* of WordPress is apparent when discussing terminology related to the [design](https://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_Design_and_Layout) of a WordPress site. At the core of WordPress, developers created a programming structure named [The Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/) to handle the processing of posts. *The Loop* is the critical [PHP](/support/article/glossary#php) program code used to display *posts*. Anyone wanting to enhance and **customize** WordPress will need to understand [the mechanics of ](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/)*[The Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/)*.

Along with The Loop, WordPress developers have created [Template Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-tags/) which are a group of PHP functions that can be invoked by designers to perform an action or display specific information. It is the *Template Tags* that form the basis of the [Template](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/) Files. *Templates (files)* contain the programming pieces, such as *Template Tags*, that control the structure and flow of a WordPress site. These files draw information from your WordPress [MySQL](/support/article/glossary#mysql) [database](https://codex.wordpress.org/Database_Description) and generate the [HTML](/support/article/glossary#html) code which is sent to the web browser. A [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/), in essence the order of processing, dictates how *Templates* control almost all aspects of the output, including [Headers](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/custom-headers/), [Sidebars](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/sidebars/), and [Archives](/support/article/introduction-to-blogging/#archives). *Archives* are a dynamically generated list of posts, and are typically grouped by [date](https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Archive_Index), [category](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/taxonomy-templates/#category), [tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Tag_Templates), or [author](https://codex.wordpress.org/Author_Templates).

As the capabilities of WordPress have improved, developers have added tools that allow users to easily manage a siteâs look and functionality:

- **Widgets** provide an easy way to add little programs, such as the current weather, to a sidebar.
- **Menus** make it easy to define the navigation buttons that are typically present near the top of a siteâs pages.
- The **Background** tool allows the user to change the background image and color of a site.
- The **Header** tool gives the user control of the images displayed at the top of a siteâs various pages.
- [Post Formats](/support/article/post-formats/) allow the user to control the display of a specific post (i.e. display this post as an Aside or as a quote or as a gallery).

[Plug](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins)[i](/support/article/plugins)[ns](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins) are custom functions created to extend the core functionality of WordPress. The WordPress developers have maximized flexibility and minimized code bloat by allowing outside developers the opportunity to create their own useful add-on features. As evidenced by the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins), thereâs a *Plugin* to enhance virtually every aspect of WordPress.

A [Plugin management tool](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins_Add_New_SubPanel) makes it extremely easy to find and install Plugins directly from the official directory.

### Administrative Terminology

Another set of terms to examine are those involving the [Administration](/support/article/administering-your-blog/) of a WordPress site. A comprehensive set of [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) enables users to **easily** administer and monitor their blog. A WordPress administrator has a number of powers which include requiring a visitor to register in order to participate in the blog, who can create new posts, whether comments can be left, and if files can be uploaded to the blog.

Some of the main administrative responsibilities of a WordPress blog involve adding, deleting, and managing [Registered Users](https://codex.wordpress.org/Registered_User_Features). Administering users means controlling [Roles and Capabilities](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/), or permissions. **Roles** control what functions a registered *user* can perform as those functions can range from just being able to login at a blog to performing the role administrator.

Another chief concern for the blog administrator is [Comment Moderation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation). [Comments](/support/article/glossary#comments), also called [discussions](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/), are responses to posts left for the post author by the visitor and represent an important part of âthe give and takeâ of a blog. But *Comments* must be [patrolled](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam) for [Spam](/support/article/glossary#spam) and other malicious intentions. The WordPress Administration [Comments Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comments_Comments_SubPanel) simplifies that process with easy-to-use screens which add, change, and delete Comments.

And not to be forgotten is the obligation for an administrator to keep their WordPress current to insure that the latest features, bugs, and security fixes are in effect. To accommodate administrators, WordPress has a simple [Upgrade Screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Upgrade_SubPanel) to download and install the latest version of WordPress. Thereâs no excuse to not upgrade!

### Help Terminology 

The final set of *jargon* relates to **helping** you with WordPress. First and foremost is the hanging Help tab that is displayed under each of the [Administration Screens](#documentation/article/administration-screens). That contextual help describes the function and use of the current screen and provides links to other help topics. And, there are other *help* resources available to WordPress users; [Finding WordPress Help](https://codex.wordpress.org/Finding_WordPress_Help), [Troubleshooting](https://codex.wordpress.org/Troubleshooting), and [WordPress FAQ (frequently asked questions)](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ) are good starting points. Also [Getting Started with WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress) will **jump-start** readers into the world of WordPress and the excellent [WordPress Lessons](/support/article/wordpress-lessons/) provide in-depth **tutorials** on many of the aspects of using WordPress. Among the most important resources is the [WordPress Support Forum](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_Support_Forums) where **knowledgeable** volunteers answer your questions and help solve any problems related to WordPress. And, of course, this Support site which is filled with hundreds of articles designed to make your WordPress experience a success!

# Toolbar <a name="documentation/article/toolbar" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/toolbar/

The **Toolbar** is an area of the screen just above the site that lists useful administration screen links such as add a new post or edit your profile.

![Admin Bar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/admin_bar-1024x26.png)ToolbarThe Toolbar contains links to information about WordPress, as well as quick-links to create new posts, pages and links, add new users, review comments, and alerts to available updates to plugins and themes on your site.

The toolbar can be turned on/off from the **Toolbar** option in [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Users](/support/article/administration-screens/#users-your-blogging-family) &gt; [Your Profile](/support/article/users-your-profile-screen/), but It is no longer possible to hide the Toolbar when viewing the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/).

---

**Note:** If you have turned the Toolbar on in your profile settings, but still donât see it on the front end of your site, it may be that your theme does not call [ ](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_footer)wp\_footer() in its footer.php file, or the Toolbar may be disabled by a plugin.

## Troubleshooting

 **Problem:** If one of the following messages is received after electing to do the Automatic Upgrade:

*Downloading update .*   
*Download failed.: Could not open handle for fopen() to latest wordpress.*  
*I*n*stallation Failed*

or

*Download failed.: name lookup timed out*   
*Installation Failed*

**Solution:** Confirm you are properly connected to the internet then do the Automatic Upgrade again.

**Problem:** After doing the upgrade, and received *WordPress upgraded successfully* message, but the following message still displays:

*An automated WordPress update has failed to complete â please attempt the update again now.*

**Solution:** Delete the **.maintenance** file found in the WordPress root/base folder, then do the Upgrade again.

**Problem:** After clicking on âautomatic upgradeâ you get a dialog box asking for âConnection Information.â And, no matter what you enter, you continue to get errors.

**Solution:**  Make sure that your entire wordpress directory is owned by the username under which your Apache server runs. For example, if your server runs as https, and your files live in /var/wordpress do a âchown -R apache.apache /var/wordpress.â Note that you might want to edit some permissions for security purposes, in particular a chmod 640 on wp-config.php, to protect access information to your database.

# Posts Categories screen <a name="documentation/article/posts-categories-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-categories-screen/

Each post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories. This aids in navigation and allows posts to be grouped with others of similar content.

Each Category may be assigned to a Category Parent, allowing you to set up a hierarchy within the Category structure. In creating Categories, recognize that each Category Name must be unique. Thus, even if two Categories have two different Parents, they must still have different names.

[![categories-screen](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/categories-screen.png?fit=1163%2C618&ssl=1)](#support)Links to your Categories are, by default, shown in two different places on your blogâs home page if you are using the [WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme](/themes/twentyseventeen/). First, WordPress lists these Category as links in your sidebar. Second, WordPress shows all the Categories to which a given post belongs under that post. When someone viewing your blog clicks on one of these Category links, an archive page with all the posts belonging to that Category will be displayed.

This Screen allows you to create new Categories, edit or delete existing ones, and organize your Categories hierarchically.

## Categories Screen

This Screen is divided into the Add New Category and Category Table sections.

### Add New Category

This part of the Screen, which is conveniently linked to from the top of the Table of Categories, allows you to create a new Category. There are four pieces of information associated with each new Category: the name, slug, category parent, and description.

**Name:** To reiterate, the Category Name *must* be unique.

**Slug:** The Category slug *must* be unique. The Category Slug is used in the URL. For example, setting a Category Name of âRecipesâ and a Category Slug of âfoodâ would show all âRecipesâ posts with a URL like **example.com/blog/food/**.

**Parent:** Use this drop-down if you want to make this Category a sub-Category; you will select the sub-Categoryâs Parent here. For example, you may have a Category called âPhotosâ but want to add further clarification about the subject of a particular âPhotosâ post. You could add âOregon Coastâ and âIce Stormâ as sub-Categories to the âPhotosâ Category; âPhotosâ would be the Parent of these two new sub-Categories.

Sub-Categories show up on your blogâs page just like Categories, except they will typically be nested under their Parent Categories. When someone visits your site and clicks the âPhotosâ Category link, all posts in âPhotosâ and *all its sub-Categories* will be displayed. Clicking the âOregon Coastâ Category link *only* displays those post in that sub-Category. If you assign a post to a sub-Category (e.g. âOregon Coastâ), you can choose to assign that post to the sub-Categoryâs parent (âPhotosâ) or not. Either way, all âOregon Coastâ posts will show up in the âPhotosâ Category page. The only difference is that the list of Categories of which a particular post is actually a member. In the WordPress [WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme](/themes/twentyseventeen/), this list is shown below the text of each post. Please note that when creating templates, you cannot match a child category based on the parent (ie: if category âbarâ has parent âfooâ, a template file named âcategory-foo.phpâ will not match any âbarâ category posts.)

**Description:**  Category Descriptions are optional. Some themes take advantage of Category Descriptions, others do not, so having Descriptions may or may not modify the way Categories are displayed for your site. Even if they are not used by your siteâs theme, you may still find them useful from an administration point of view.

**Add New Category**: The most important part of the Add New Category box. Once youâve entered in all the information about your new Category, use this button to save it.

### Table of Categories

This table lists all of your categories by row. Categories are displayed hierarchically and alphabetically; subcategories are displayed beneath their parents and are prefaced by long dashes. These dashed are *not* part of a Categoryâs name; they are there only to show hierarchy.

The table of categories contains the following columns:

- **\[ \]** â A checkbox that when clicked (checked), âselectsâ that particular Category to be deleted when the Delete Action is Applied.
- **Name** â The name of the Category. (Each name must be unique)
- **Description** â Categories may have an optional description. By default, the description is shown to viewers when they hover over the categoryâs link.
- **Slug** â The slug of a Category. (Usually in lower case letters)
- **Posts** â The number of posts which are members of the Category. Click on the number in the Posts column to be directed to the All [Posts Screen](/support/articles/posts-screen) to manage the Posts in that Category.

#### Screen Options

The Screen Options allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. In addition, the number of Categories to display in the Table of Categories can be set. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.

#### Search

Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the âSearch Categoriesâ button to search and display all the Categories meeting your search words.

### Using Selection, Actions, and Apply

#### Selection

This section allows Actions to be performed on one or more Categories displayed in the Table. For Actions to be performed on multiple Categories at once, those Categories must be first **selected** via one of these methods:

- **Select one Category at a time** â To select a Category, the checkbox to the left of the Category entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Categories by checking their respective checkbox.
- **Select all Categories in given Table** â All Categories in a given table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Tableâs title, or footer bar. Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected).
- **Reverse Selection** â A Reverse Selection means checked items become unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse Selection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and clicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.

#### Actions

Actions describe the process to be performed on particular Categories. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as *Bulk Actions* and *Immediate Actions*. The follow describes these Actions:

- **Bulk Actions** â These Actions can be performed on one, or more Categories, at one time, if those Categories have been previously selected. Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Actions pull-down box, above each Table. The only Bulk Action allowed is Delete.
- **Immediate Actions** â Immediate Actions are performed immediately, on an individual Category. Hovering the mouse cursor over the Category row reveals the Edit, Quick Edit, Delete and View options under the Name column in that Category row. Clicking on a Category Name will also initiate the Edit Action.

The available Actions are described below:

- **Edit** â This Immediate Action displays the Edit Category Screen to edit the Category fields. This Action can be initiated by click on the Category Name or clicking on the Edit option just below the Category Name.
- **Quick Edit** â This Immediate Action initiates the Quick Edit of that Category.
- **Delete** â This Action deletes the Category. Delete is available as a Bulk Action and an Immediate Action. Note: Deleting a category does not delete the posts in that Category, but the posts that were assigned to the deleted Category are assigned to the **Default Category**, as defined in the Settings Writing Screen. Note that the Default Category cannot be deleted.
- **View** â This Action, if supported by the active themeâs template, will display the Posts belonging to the Category. View is available only as an Immediate Action.

#### Apply

After one or more Categories are *selected*, and after a *Bulk* Action is specified, the **Apply** button performs the given Action on the selected Categories.

- **Apply** â Click the Apply button to execute the Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pull-down, on the selected Categories. Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Categories must be **selected**, as described before.

### Quick Edit

The following fields can be change via the Quick Edit Action:

**Category name**: To reiterate, the Category name *must* be unique. Category slug Again, the Category slug *must* be unique.

**Cancel**: Click this button to cancel any changes and return to the Table of Categories

**Update Category**: Once youâve edited all the information about the Category, use this button to save the changes.

### Edit Category

This Screen is displayed by clicking on a Categoriesâ **Name** in the Table of Categories or clicking on the Edit option just below the Category Name. It is possible to edit four pieces of information associated with each Category: the name, the slug, the parent, and the description.

**Category name** and **Category Slug**: Category name and Category Slug *must* be unique.

**Category Parent**: Use this drop-down if you want to make this Category a sub-Category; you will select the sub-Categoryâs Parent here. For example, you may have a Category called âPhotosâ but want to add further clarification about the subject of a particular âPhotosâ post. You could add âOregon Coastâ and âIce Stormâ as sub-Categories to the âPhotosâ Category; âPhotosâ would be the parent of these two new sub-Categories.

**Description**: Category descriptions are optional. Some themes take advantage of Category descriptions, others do not, so having Descriptions may or may not modify the way Categories are displayed for your site.

**Update**: Once youâve changed the Category information, use this button to save the changes.

# Posts Tags screen <a name="documentation/article/posts-tags-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-tags-screen/

Every post in WordPress can be filed under one or more Tags. This aids in navigation and allows posts and to be grouped with others of similar content.

Unlike Categories, Tags have no hierarchy so there is no Parent-&gt;Child relationship like that of Categories. But like Categories, Tag names must be unique.

Assuming you are using the WordPress [Twenty Seventeen theme](/themes/twentyseventeen/), Tags are displayed under each post. When someone viewing your blog clicks on one of these Tag links, a Tag archive page with all the posts belonging to that Tag, will be displayed. In addition, if using Widgets, the Tag Cloud Widget can be added to the sidebar to display all the Tags used in a cloud (Tags sized by number of times reference in posts).

**Tag Name**: To reiterate, the Tag Name *must* be unique.

**Tag Slug**: The Tag slug *must* be unique. The âslugâ is the URL-friendly version of the name. It is usually all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens. For example, setting a Tag Name of âRecipesâ and a Tag Slug of âfoodâ would show all âRecipesâ posts with a URL like **example.com/blog/food/**.

# Appearance Widgets Screen (Classic Editor) <a name="documentation/article/appearance-widgets-screen-classic-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/appearance-widgets-screen-classic-editor/

**Note:** This is documentation for the Classic Widgets Screen. The documentation for the [Block-based Widgets editor can be found here.](#documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor)

Themes usually have at least 1 or 2 sidebars. Each section in the sidebar is known as a âWidgetâ that you can add or remove, and move up or down. You configure Widgets in your sidebar by via the **Appearance Widgets Screen**. Some themes also are configured to accept widgets in certain parts of the footer and header.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/wigets-screen.png?fit=932%2C606&ssl=1)](#support)widgets screen### Widgets Management in Customizer

You can add, rearrange and remove Widgets just like in Appearance Widgets Screen, but you also get a live preview of your changes. From the Appearance Widgets Screen, click the âManage in Customizerâ link at the top to access the Widgets section of Theme Customizer.

### Configuring Your Widgets

1. Click on **Appearance &gt; Widgets** from the main navigation menu in your Dashboard.
2. Add new widgets from the Available Widgets section by dragging them to the Sidebar you want to customize. (There might be more than one sidebar option, depending on your theme.)
3. Preview your site and you should see the content from your new Widget.
4. Return to the Widgets Screen to continue adding Widgets to the Sidebar as needed.
5. To arrange the Widgets within the Sidebar, **click, drag and drop** the widgets in the order you want.
6. To customize the Widget features, click the **down arrow** (or edit link) in the upper right corner to expand the Widgetâs interface.
7. To save the Widgetâs customization, click **Save**. (If simply moving a widget to the sidebar without making customizations, you do not need to click the Save button.)
8. Preview your site again, and all of your changes should be visible.

### Remove a Widget

1. Click on **Appearance &gt; Widgets** from the main navigation menu in your Dashboard.
2. Decide which Sidebar from which you want to remove your widget if there is more than one option.
3. For the Widget that is to be removed, click the **down arrow** (or edit link) in the upper right corner to expand the Widgetâs interface
4. Click the **Delete** link in the dialog box.
5. The Widget will now be removed permanently.
6. Preview your site to see your changes.

**Note:** If you would like to remove a widget temporarily and keep your settings, drag the widget from the Sidebar into the Inactive Widgets section. When you are ready to return the widget, drag it from your Inactive Widgets section back to the Sidebar.

### Moving a Widget

To move a Widget:

1. The Widget must be located in a Sidebar or other active content area before it can be moved.

# Appearance Theme File Editor Screen <a name="documentation/article/appearance-theme-file-editor-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/appearance-theme-file-editor-screen/

Among the many user editable files in a standard WordPress installation are a Themeâs Template and Stylesheet files. The **Appearance Theme File Editor Screen** allows you to edit those Theme files.

[![appearance-editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/appearance-editor-1024x554.png)](#documentation/files/2019/01/appearance-editor.png)Appearance Editor### Edit Themes

The built-in Theme File Editor allows you to view or change (see next paragraph) any code kept in a Theme Template or Stylesheet files. The particular file contents are displayed in the large text (or edit) box that dominates this Screen.

If a specific file is writable, changes can be made, and saved. If a file is not writable, the message **You need to make this file writable before you can save your changes.** You need to change the File Permissions before changes can be saved.

The name of the Theme file being edited is displayed at the top of the text box. If the full text of the file cannot be viewed, a scroll bar to the right of the text box is provided. Since Theme files are pure text, no images or pictures can be inserted into the text box.

**Select theme to edit**

From this pull-down box, select the Theme that needs to be edited and click the Select button on the right. Once the Select button is clicked that Themes Template and Styles files will be listed on the right side of the text box and the Stylesheet (style.css) file for that Theme will be placed in the text box.

**Theme Files**

Listed to the right of the large text box is a list of the Theme Template or Stylesheet files that can be edited. Click on any of the file links to place the text of that file in the edit box.

Be very careful editing PHP files of your current theme. The editor does not make backup copies. If you introduce an error that crashes your site, you cannot use the editor to fix the problem. In such a case, use FTP to either upload a functional backup of the problem file or change the folder name of the current theme so WordPress is forced to use a different theme.

### Update File

Remember to click this button to save the changes you have made to the file. After clicking this button you should see a splash message at the top of the screen saying File Edited Successfully. If you donât see that message, then your changes are not saved! Note that if a file is not writeable the Update File button will not be available.

**Note:** Changing files in this manner is not recommended. If you update the theme all of your changes will be lost. The best way to avoid this is through the use of a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/).

# Plugins screen <a name="documentation/article/plugins-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/plugins-screen/

The **Plugins Screen** enables you to manage your Plugins. Management of Plugins entails activating, deactivating, updating, editing, and deleting Plugins that are **installed**.

Visit the [Plugins Add New Screen](/support/articles/plugins-add-new-screen) to install new plugins by clicking Add New link at the top of this screen or Select **Plugins &gt; Add New** from left side menu. Once a plugin has been installed, you may activate it here.

## Manage Plugins

Once a plugin is installed, you may activate it, deactivate it, edit the Plugin file, delete the Plugin, or Upgrade the Plugin. As a special note regarding the Plugin Upgrade processâwhen Plugins need to be updated, the left navigation menu Plugin option will display a balloon, with a number inside the balloon. That number represents the number of Plugins that need to be Updated.

On visiting the **Plugins Screen**, there may be a splash warning message, similar to, *The plugin âsome plugin nameâ has been **deactivated** due to an error: xxxxxxxxxxxx.* If such a message is displayed, investigation is required to find out why a particular Plugin was deactivated. Possible causes for the deactivation are, (1) an incomplete set of plugin files, (2) the plugin is coded incorrectly, or (3) the Plugin is dependent on another Plugin, and that Plugin is missing, deactivated, or has problems.

### Table of Plugins

A table lists all of your Plugins, by row. The plugins are listed in alphabetical order.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/plugins-screen.png?fit=1221%2C400&ssl=1)](#support)The table of Plugins contains the following columns:

- **\[ \]** â This checkbox, when clicked (checked), âselectsâ that particular plugin to be processed by a Bulk Action.
- **Plugin** â The name of the Plugin.
- **Description** â information about its Plugin. Includes version number, Plugin author name and link to the pluginâs web site for more detail information or support.

#### Page Navigation

Above and below the Table, to the right, the number of Plugins displayed per page is determined. If more then one page of Plugins is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided. Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward. Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display.

#### Screen Options

**Screen Options**, displayed as a hanging tab under **the toolbar**, allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options. In addition, the number of Plugins per page can be set.

[![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/plugins-screen-options.png?fit=235%2C174&ssl=1)](#support)screen options#### Search

Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the âSearch Installed Pluginsâ button to search and display all the Posts meeting your search words.

### Filtering Options

At the top of this Screen are links such as All, Active, Inactive, Recently Active, Update Available, that when clicked, will cause just the Plugins of that type to be displayed in the underlying Table.

**All**: lists all installed Plugins.

**Active**: lists currently active Plugins. Note that each Active Plugin is displayed in a light green background.

**Inactive**: lists installed, but inactive Plugins.

**Recently Active**: lists recently deactivated Plugins. When a plugin has been inactive for more than 7 days it will be dropped off.

**Update Available**: lists upgrade available Plugins at the [WordPress Plugin Directory](/plugins/).

### Using Selection, Actions, and Apply

#### Selection

 The Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more Plugins selected in the Table. For Bulk Actions to be performed on multiple Plugins at once, those Plugins must be first **selected** via one of these methods:

The various Tables in this Screen allow Actions to be performed on one or more Plugins. For Actions to be performed on multiple Plugins at once, those Plugins must be first **selected** via one of these methods:

- **Select one Plugin at a time** â To select a Plugin, the checkbox to the left of the Plugin entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Plugins by checking their respective checkbox.
- **Select all Plugins in given Table** â All Plugins in a given table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Tableâs title, or footer bar. Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected).
- **Reverse Selection** â A Reverse Selection means checked items become unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse Selection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and clicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.

#### Actions

Actions describe the process to be performed on particular Plugins. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as *Bulk Actions* and *Immediate Actions*. The follow describes these Actions:

- **Bulk Actions** â These Actions can be performed on one, or more Plugins, at one time, if those Plugins have been previously selected. Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Actions **pull-down** box, above each Table. The Bulk Actions are Activate, Deactivate, Update and Delete.
- **Immediate Actions** â Immediate Actions are performed immediately, on an individual Plugin, by clicking the Activate, Deactivate, Edit, or Delete links, displayed under the Action column in that Plugin row. The Upgrade Action is also an Immediate Action, but the Upgrade link is seen in the upgrade message below the Plugin row, and the Upgrade **nag** message only appears if there is an upgrade available at the WordPress Plugins site.

The list of Actions available are described below:

- **Activate** â This Action enables a Plugin, or better yet, turns the Plugin on. Activating a Plugin is necessary to use the features of a Plugin. Only Inactive Plugins can be activated. Activate can be either a Bulk Action, or an Immediate Action.

Note: Successful activation will display a splash message at the top of the Screen (e.g. *Plugin **activated**.* or *Selected plugins **activated**.*) **Failure to activate** a Plugin results in the message *Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a **fatal error*** â this should be further investigated. Likely causes of failure are (1) an incomplete set of plugin files, (2) the plugin is coded incorrectly, (3) or the Plugin is dependent on another Plugin before it can be successfully activated.

- **Deactivate** â This Action disables, or turns off, a Plugin. Only Active Plugins can be deactivated. Deactivate is either a Bulk Action, or an Immediate Action.

Note: Successful deactivation will display a splash message at the top of the Screen (e.g. *Plugin **deactivated***. or *Selected plugins **deactivated**.*)

- **Delete** â This Action deletes the Plugins files. Only Inactive Plugins can be deleted. Delete is either a Bulk Action, or an Immediate Action.
- **Upgrade** â This Action initiates the Plugin upgrade process.
- **Edit** â This Immediate Action places the Plugin code in the Plugins Editor text box for editing. **Warning**: Making changes to active plugins is not recommended. If your changes cause a fatal error, the plugin will be automatically deactivated.

#### Apply

After one or more Plugins are *selected*, and after a *Bulk* Action is specified, the **Apply** button performs the given Action on the selected Plugins.

- **Apply** â Click the Apply button to execute the Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pull-down, on the selected Plugins. Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Plugins must be **selected**, as described before.

Successful application of the Action is noted in a splash message at the top of the Screen. For instance, when the Activate Action is applied, the message *Selected plugins activated.*â is displayed.

#### Deleting Plugins

When the Delete Action is Applied to selected Plugin(s), a Screen similar to the follow is displayed:

*Deleting the selected plugins will remove the following plugin(s) and their files:*  
*\* Plugin xyx by John Doe*  
*\* Plugin abc by Jane JoeAre you sure you wish to delete these files?*

- **Yes Delete these Files** â This is the final chance, because clicking this will delete the Plugin(s), and return to the **Plugins Screen** with the *The selected plugins have been deleted.* splash message displayed.

Note: If deletion is unsuccessful The message *Plugin could not be deleted due to an error: xxxxxxxxx.* This should be further investigated.

- **No, Return me to the plugin list** â Click this to be returned to the **Plugins Screen**
- **Click to view entire list of files which will be deleted** â Clicking this causes a listing of all the files that are part of the Plugins being deleted.

#### Upgrading Plugins

**Important note:** If a Plugin is hosted at the [WordPress Plugins Directory](/plugins/) Upgrade notices will be displayed, when appropriate, for a given Plugin. If the Plugin is hosted elsewhere, such as the Plugin authorâs site, it is important for you to check for available updates for those Plugins.

- **Update Now** â When the plugin is already installed but not the latest version, it is labeled as Update Now.
- **Installed** â When the latest plugin is already installed, it is labeled as Installed, and deactivated.

If there are many Plugins found with your search, there will be Page Numbers at the top of the Table that will allow you to navigate to those pages. If you donât see the Plugin you wish to install, execute a new Search via the boxes at the top of the Table.

#### Install Now

If the Install Now is clicked for a Plugin in one of the search Tables, it will install the plugin and display messages similar to the following:

- *Installing Plugin: WP-DB-Backup xxx*
- *Downloading plugin package from XXXXX*
- *Unpacking the plugin package*
- *Installing the plugin*

# Tools Network screen <a name="documentation/article/tools-network-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tools-network-screen/

In WordPress you have the ability to create a network of sites (multisite). To enable the Network ability, you must first define multisite in the wp-config.php file. Note that because the Network ability requires a certain level of expertise, developers intentional require manual configuration of the wp-config.php file to enable Networks.

[![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/tools-network.png?fit=1264%2C792&ssl=1)](#support)Network Creation screen### Create a Network of WordPress Sites

To start the process of creating a Network, you first must tell WordPress to allow multisites, and by doing do enable the Network menu item to appear in the Tools menu. It is there you will configure certain aspects of your network. So first, edit the wp-config.php file and add the following line to the file:

```
define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);
```

**Considerations**

- Giving WordPress Its Own Directory will not work in WordPress 3.0 with multisite enabled. It interferes with the member blog lookup.
- You cannot create a network in the following cases:

 âWordPress address (URL)â is different from âSite address (URL)â âWordPress address (URL)â is used IP address such as 127.0.0.1 or port number other than â:80â, â:443â. Use âlocalhostâ instead of â127.0.0.1â, if on local computer.

### Addresses of Sites in your Network

The primary information in this section involves the decision to use sub-domains or sub-directories for your sites. This means each additional site in your network will be created as a new virtual sub-domain or sub-directory. Please choose whether you would like sites in your WordPress network to use sub-domains or sub-directories. **You cannot change this later**.

**Sub-domains**

Check this radio button to utilize sub-domains for your sites. Examples of sub-domains are **site1.example.com** and **site2.example.com**. This features works by using wildcard subdomains. You must have this enabled in Apache, and you must also add a wildcard sub-domain to your DNS records. Some hosts will not support this, so you may need to ask your host before enabling this feature.

**Sub-directories**

Check this radio button to utilize sub-directories for your sites. Examples of sub-directories are **example.com/site1** and **example.com/site2**. Sub-directories work with mod\_rewrite.

Note: If you wish to use fully qualified domains, you still need to pick a format to start with. Then after verifying they work, use the Domain mapping plugin.

#### Alternative Messages

**Sub-domain Install**

This messages displays if you are changing from a stand-alone version of WordPress to the multisite version this will display.  
  
*Because your install is not new, the sites in your WordPress network must use sub-domains. The main site in a sub-directory install will need to use a modified permalink structure, potentially breaking existing links.*

**Sub-directory Install**

This messages displays if you are using localhost as a domain.  
  
*Because you are using `localhost`, the sites in your WordPress network must use sub-directories. Consider using `localhost.localdomain` if you wish to use sub-domains.*

### Network Details

**Server Address**

The Internet address of your network will be `example.com`. This information is filled in automatically. Note: if your existing URL has **www** such as **www.example.com** you will see this message: â*We recommend you change your siteurl to `example.com` before enabling the network feature. It will still be possible to visit your site using the `www` prefix with an address like `www.sample.com` but any links will not have the `www` prefix.*â

**Network Title**

What would you like to call your network? A suggested title is supplied but edit that to reflect the title you want to use.

**Admin E-mail Address**

Your email address. A suggested email is supplied, but change as necessary.

### Install

Click the **Install** button to start the network install.

#### Installation Warnings

You may receive a warning about wildcard subdomains.  
  
**To use a subdomain configuration, you must have a wildcard entry in your DNS. This usually means adding a \* hostname record pointing at your web server in your DNS configuration tool.**  
  
**Warning! Wildcard DNS may not be configured correctly!**  
  
**The installer attempted to contact a random hostname (599af5.sample.com) on your domain. This resulted in an error message: Couldnât resolve host â599af5.sample.comâ**   
**You can still use your site but any subdomain you create may not be accessible. If you know your DNS is correct, ignore this message.**

### Enabling the Network

Once the Network install is completed this Screen displays with these directions. Follow the directions in the order presented to complete the process.

[![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/tools-network-created.png?fit=1277%2C925&ssl=1)](#support)**Caution We recommend you back up your existing wp-config.php and .htaccess files.**

1\. Create a blogs.dir directory in /wp-content.  
This directory is used to stored uploaded media for your additional sites and must be writeable by the web server. Note that the directory should be CHOWNed and CHMODed the same as your wp-content folder.

If youâve set the **WP\_CONTENT\_DIR** constant to something other than *wp-content* you may want to reconsider as you will see this message: *Warning: Networks may not be fully compatible with custom wp-content directories.*

2\. Add the following to your wp-config.php file in /public\_html/ above the line reading /\* Thatâs all, stop editing! Happy blogging. \*/   
These lines are automatically generated and will look similar to this.

```
define( 'MULTISITE', true );
define( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', true );
$base = '/';
define( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'sample.com' );
define( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );
define( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
define( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );
```

These unique authentication keys are also missing from your wp-config.php file. To make your installation more secure, you should also add These lines are automatically generated and will look similar to this.

```
define( 'AUTH_KEY', '{K 2rUF&uy(Ak0(M3J%f(W&ADLiI(+#^W*H|0@jdAc(0LHOz3)gaiOoDgN_;W+2' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_KEY', ']n+=#}^=3BdTn~FoS@8K#o|~WgC@#?Oj*s[L+Y+tInaOjNCFa1h59vRL#!R[[{UI' );

define( 'NONCE_KEY', 'fkrSg(v-|/&=TC{66rgrX[_VpWv$.{a{q$CvjvjB$AP<5q?|58{6xvN{xut r?|j' );
define( 'AUTH_SALT', 'kVVt8^+oh,$|?g RxaWq_Px RwC%^^r?8zhQ+GDUWp:QB]W!tPHins]RJ@a%P_ue' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_SALT','>|tv)^94YuNk[:+)l<5ubJ0uTdo3gn9|YN.0J/MR1R>T=oe1}eov*ds@Z.&PA%&q' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_SALT', 'E,C#!<lf6B $y;-nfjP10$rea?g/_A,V0tkbqCNJMfOO)Ml4&JUhM]bU[*w]oh,X' );
define( 'NONCE_SALT', '$qbgS^/Dj.RJC-,S<y9L7SV9EMuyB <wQS`}poc;Yd{PGa$!,b*oL<qX!cPMqXh`' ); 
```

3\. Add the following to your .htaccess file in /public\_html/sample.com/, replacing other WordPress rules If there isnât a .htaccess file, then create it. These lines are automatically generated and will look similar to this.

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
#uploaded files
RewriteRule ^files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$1 [L]
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d RewriteRule ^ - [L]
RewriteRule . index.php [L]  
```

Once you complete these steps, your network is enabled and configured. You will have to log in again

Click the Log In link. You will now see a new menu section called **Super Admin**. The menus contained in there are for adding and managing additional sites in your network. Your base WordPress install is now the main site in your network.

Visit the Administration &gt; Network Admin &gt; Settings Screen to configure network options. After that you will need to create sites and users.

## Troubleshooting

- If after enabling networking/multisite and you are not able to login, try clearing your browser cache AND cookies, then try to login.

# Become a WordPress contributor <a name="documentation/article/become-a-wordpress-contributor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/become-a-wordpress-contributor/

Thank you for contributing to the project we all love! Your participation is vital to the WordPress project.

WordPress is a user-driven project, and all developments and enhancements depend on users like **you**! Please consider contributing to the project and the WordPress Community in one or more of the ways outlined below. Contributions from users like you keep the project vibrant, alive, and on the path of progress.

Whether youâre a budding developer, a pixel-perfect designer, or just like helping out, weâre always looking for people to help make WordPress even better. Below is an overview of ways to get involved and help out. If you want to dive right in, visit <https://make.wordpress.org/>.

## Documentation

All of the WordPress user and developer documentation has been produced by users like you and me! The many different ways in which you can volunteer your time and effort to improve the quality and scope of documentation are outlined in [Documentation Contributor Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/).

The slack channel [\#docs](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/C02RP4WU5) is the forum for discussing all issues related to documentation.

## Translation

[Translating WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/) describes the process of translating the WordPress software, so that people can use WordPress for blogs in languages other than English. This article tells you how to find and join the teams that are translating WordPress.

The slack channel [\#polyglots](http://wordpress.slack.com/messages/polyglots/) is for questions, suggestions and discussions related to translating WordPress; please feel free to join in.

To get involved with the Translation team, please review <https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/>.

## WordPress Support Forum

Another valuable contribution you can make is donating some of your time to help other users of WordPress. All WordPress related support at the [WordPress Support Forum](https://www.wordpress.org/support) is provided free of cost, and the involvement of users is essential to maintain this.

If youâd like to help, read visit <https://make.wordpress.org/support/> for more information.

## WordPress Chat on Slack

Slack has replaced IRC as a way to organize and get work done on WordPress. The community is vibrant, responsive, and very active. Please join us on our [Slack channel](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) and start getting involved today.

There is a weekly [meetup of core developers](https://make.wordpress.org/core/weekly-developer-chats/) in #core on Slack. Agendas, minutes, and discussion between meetups all take place on the [WordPress Development Blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/).

While the IRC Live chat is still active, our Slack Channel is where we are getting work done. Please join us on <https://make.wordpress.org/chat/.>

## WordPress Development

You can help with the [development of the WordPress software](https://make.wordpress.org/), whether or not you are a software developer.

### Development Planning

One way to participate in WordPress development is to suggest features and participate in the [development planning](https://codex.wordpress.org/Development_Planning) process. Even if you arenât a developer, you can help build consensus and formalize proposals, boiling down long email threads and IRC logs to their essence, so that developers can quickly ascertain what the community is hoping to achieve with a particular feature.

### Testing WordPress

Another valuable contribution a non-developer (or developer) can make to WordPress development is to test WordPress. Before every stable release of WordPress, pre-release versions are made to enable testing. You can download the pre-releases and test them, so that the WordPress developers can fix problems before the new version is made available to the public. If you would like to get involved in this effort, join the [wp-testers mailing list](https://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Testers), where new releases are announced and discussed.

If you want to be on the bleeding edge of development, even before pre-release versions are put together, you can also check out the latest software from the WordPress Subversion (SVN) repository, as outlined in [Using Subversion](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Subversion). Or, you can get the ânightly buildâ (which is created from the Subversion repository, and available as a zip file) at [\#nightly-builds/wordpress-latest.zip](#nightly-builds/wordpress-latest.zip) â almost as up-to-date as the instantaneous Subversion repository.

If you find bugs while testing pre-release or already-released versions of WordPress, see the section just below.

### Reporting Bugs

Another way you can contribute to WordPress development is by reporting any problems you find with the WordPress software. The process of reporting bugs is described in [Reporting Bugs](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-bugs/) â please start by reading that article. Once you have understood the bug reporting process, you can search the WordPress [Trac](https://trac.wordpress.org/) database to see if your issue has already been reported, and if not, file a new report. Your help with reporting bugs will be highly appreciated.

### Fixing Bugs and Other Programming

If you are a software developer, you can also help the development of WordPress by fixing problems that have been reported by you or another person in the WordPress [Trac](https://trac.wordpress.org/) database. This process is also known as âpatchingâ, and is described in [Reporting Bugs](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-bugs/). That article also has some suggestions on how to find bugs to fix.

You can also subscribe to the [wp-hackers mailing list](https://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists#Hackers) to participate in discussions regarding WordPress development. All contributions, ideas and suggestions are welcome at the mailing list. Sometimes, requests are also made on the list asking for the help of volunteers to assist in the improvement and development of specific functionality.

Occasionally there are also bug scrubs in the [\#core](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core/) [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) channel. They are usually announced ahead of time on the [make/core blog](https://make.wordpress.org/core/), and more details about what a bug scrub involves is available in the [core team handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/bug-gardening/).

You may also be interested to read this page on [How does code make it into WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/How_does_code_make_it_into_WordPress). It details how bug fixes, code and new features are included into the next releases of WordPress.

## Show You Care

If you enjoy WordPress or find it to be useful, put a link to WordPress on your site. You can do this with a text link, or use one of the many [WordPress logos](#about/logos) on your site with a link to [http://wordpress.org](https://www.wordpress.org/). Show you care.

## Donating Money

The WordPress Community exists because everyone takes part in some way, by giving their time, energy, and sometimes even money, because they believe in the valuable services WordPress provides. We invite you to join the community in whatever way you feel is appropriate, and donating money to WordPress Theme and Plugin authors and developers who give so freely of their creativity and expertise by offering their services for free to all WordPress users is a good place to start.

If you use a WordPress Theme or Plugin and your WordPress blog depends upon it, contact the author and find out how you can give back and support their continued efforts. It takes a lot of time and energy to create and then support Themes and Plugins, keeping them updated as WordPress changes and bugs are found. Many take donations or appreciate it when you blog about their Plugin or Theme. Others offer their Plugins and Themes as *experiential portfolios*â you play with it, you like it, you hire them. Most clearly indicate how they appreciate compensation for their hard work â give back to WordPress by giving back to them.

The more the WordPress Community supports the programmers, developers, testers, and challengers, the stronger and better WordPress becomes. Sometimes that means donating money, sometimes it means saying thank you.

Just remember, every contribution counts, no matter what it looks like. It takes every one of us to make WordPress better.

# Tools Export screen <a name="documentation/article/tools-export-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tools-export-screen/

## Tools â Export

Exporting your WordPress data (posts, pages, custom post types, comments, custom fields, categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and users) is sometimes necessary and useful. If you are moving to a new host or just want a backup of your site data, then Exporting your site is the answer. Once the export file is created, that file can be used for import by the [Tools Import Screen. ](/support/articles/tools-import-screen/)

The **Tools Export Screen** is quite simpleâjust specify the desired Filters, if any, you wish to apply, and then click the Download Export File button to save that file to your local computer.

[![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/tools-export-screen.png?fit=981%2C415&ssl=1)](#support)## Export

When you click the Download Export File button, WordPress will create an XML file for you to save to your computer.

This format, which is called and WordPress eXtended RSS or WXR file, will contain your posts, pages, custom post types, comments, custom fields, categories, tags, custom taxonomies, and users.

Once youâve saved the download file, you can use Administration &gt; Tools &gt; Import &gt; WordPress at another WordPress site to import this data

### Filters and Other Options

- **All content** â export all of your posts, pages, comments, custom fields, terms, navigation menus, and custom posts.
- **Posts** â check this radio button to expose additional filtering when exporting posts.
- Categories â select only one category with this pulldown or leave at All Categories.
- Authors â select a specific author from the pulldown or leave at All Authors.
- Date range â select both the starting and ending post date to include in export.
- Status â select the post status (e.g. Published) to export or leave at All Status.
- Pages â check this radio button to expose additional filtering when exporting pages.
- Authors â select a specific author from the pulldown or leave at All Authors.
- Date range â select both the starting and ending page date to include in export.
- Status â select the page status (e.g. Published) to export or leave at All Status.
- Download Export File â click this button and the file, with any filters selected, will be created and you will be asked to save that file to your local computer.

# Revisions <a name="documentation/article/revisions" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/revisions/

## Description

The WordPress revisions system stores a record of each saved draft or published update. The revision system allows you to see what changes were made in each revision by dragging a slider (or using the Next/Previous buttons). The display indicates what has changed in each revision â what was added, what remained unchanged, and what was removed. Lines added or removed are highlighted, and individual character changes get additional highlighting. Click the âRestore This Revisionâ button to restore a revision.

The revisions page also includes a âcompare any two revisionsâ mode that allows you to compare any two individual revisions. In this mode, the slider has two handles, one representing the revision you are comparing from and one representing the revision you are comparing to. Drag the handles to see what has changed between any two specific revisions. **Note:** the âRestore This Revisionâ button *always restores the revision you are comparing to*.

To return to the post edit screen without restoring a revision, click on the post title at the top of the page.

## Autosaves

There is only ever a maximum of one [autosave ](/support/article/glossary#autosave)per user for any given post. New autosaves overwrite old autosaves. This means that no, your tables do not grow by one row every 60 seconds. In multi-user settings, one autosave is stored for each user.

Autosaves are enabled for all posts and pages but do not overwrite published content. Autosaves are stored as a special type of revision; they do not overwrite the actual post. In fact, whether your power goes out, your browser crashes, or you lose your internet connection, when you go back to edit that post, WP will toss up a warning telling you that it has a backup of your post and a link to restore the backup. When reviewing revisions, autosaves are clearly marked.

## Revision Options

Limit the number of posts revisions that WordPress stores in the database.

The [wp\_revisions\_to\_keep](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_revisions_to_keep) filter allows developers to easily alter how many revisions are kept for a given post.

Alternately, the limit can be set in wp-config.php:

```
define( 'WP_POST_REVISIONS', 3 );
```

WP\_POST\_REVISIONS:

- true (default), -1: store every revision
- false, 0: do not store any revisions (except the one autosave per post)
- (int) &gt; 0: store that many revisions (+1 autosave per user) per post. Old revisions are automatically deleted when the post is updated again.

## Revision Storage Method

Revisions are stored in the posts table.

Revisions are stored as children of their associated post (the same thing we do for attachments). They are given a post\_status of âinheritâ, a post\_type of ârevisionâ, and a post\_name of {parent ID}- revision(-#) for regular revisions and {parent ID}-autosave for autosaves.

By default, WP keeps track of the changes to title, author, content, excerpt.

## Revision Management

Deleting: There is an API function to delete revisions, but there is no UI. That can certainly change.

## Displaying Rendered Revisions

Currently revision comparison âdiffsâ are rendered in Text (or HTML) view; proposed filters would allow plugin developers to customize diff encoding/rendering. (see Trac ticket [\#24908](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24908))

# How WordPress processes Post Content <a name="documentation/article/how-wordpress-processes-post-content" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/how-wordpress-processes-post-content/

WordPress processes text entered in the [Write Post Screen](#documentation/article/administration-screens) multiple times before the text is finally displayed on a web page within your WordPress blog. The processing of the text filters out the unwanted code and conforms the text to a form that the browser can interpret. Without attention to detail and familiarity with WordPressâs post content filtering, this can cause unwanted changes.

The majority of the conversion and filters are found in the `<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/5.1.0/src/wp-includes/formatting.php#L0">wp-includes/formatting.php</a>` file.

Some typical problems some users have with these filtering and processing functions are:

1. Empty paragraphs, closing span tags, and line break (BR) elements are removed upon saving.
2. Classes are removed from elements.
3. DIV elements are converted to P elements.
4. Javascripts and code are converted to displayable code rather than actionable code. See [Using Javascript](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Javascript) for information on how to incorporate Javascript into a blog post.

The following is step-by-step list of how WordPress processes post content text before the final version is displayed.

## Visual Editor

Not all WordPress bloggers use Visual Editor, but if you do, it will change various codes upon saving an entry to prepare it for publishing.

## wpautop() WordPress Function

[`wpautop()`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wpautop) is a core WordPress [function](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/) that automatically processes, fixes, and modifies the text of a post.

It puts in line breaks, paragraph tags, opens and closes tags that arenât opened and closed, and cleans up duplicate HTML tags.

## Texturize

Texturize ([wptexturize()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wptexturize)) is a text filter enabled by default that modifies posted text or comments to present a more readable and visually attractive output.

While it creates aesthetically pleasant text, it might create difficulties when posting code examples in a programming language. In such situations modification of the text is not desirable because it might create syntactically incorrect code.

A few examples include:

```
"quoted text" becomes âquoted textâ
'quoted text' becomes âquoted textâ
          --- becomes â
           -- becomes â
          ... becomes â¦
          (c) becomes Â©
          (r) becomes Â®
         (tm) becomes â¢
           '' becomes â
           `` becomes â
  president's becomes presidentâs
  presidents' becomes presidentsâ
          12' becomes 12â²
          12" becomes 12â³
          2x4 becomes 2Ã4
```

## Convert Smilies

The `convert_smilies()` function converts combinations of characters into [smilies or emoticons](/support/article/using-smilies/) within the post, page, and comment text. For example, if smilies are enabled, WordPress will recognize â:â and âDâ (:D) and turn it into a smiling face ( ð ).

The key to making smilies work is to put a space before and after the keystroke combination. If placed up against the text, it will not convert.

If conversion of smilies is not desired, turn it off through the **Settings &gt; Writing** panel.

## Convert Characters

The `formatting.php` code file contains numerous functions which help publish character entities, accents, and non-English characters to a form recognizable by the web browser.

Generally, these work excellently, however, your browser may not recognize various language characters unless that language is activated in your web browser. See your browserâs documentation for more information on adding language character recognition to your browser.

## Methods to Prevent Processing

There are a variety of Plugins to change the filtering process WordPress uses by default. It is highly recommended that you do not change the core programming but use WordPress Plugins to change all or some of the content processing. See the [WordPress Plugins Directory](#plugins) for various Plugins that change the post content filtering process.

# Use character entities <a name="documentation/article/use-character-entities" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-character-entities/

## Character Entities or Extended Characters

In many WordPress sites, you will see odd symbols that will pop up from time to time. Often these symbols appear in navigation links. For instance, look at the the double left angle quotes **(Â«)** and the double right angle quotes **(Â»)** in this example:

```
<a href="/support/article/fun-character-entities/">Â« Â« Previous Post Title</a>Â Â Â Â |Â Â Â Â <a href="/support/article/fun-character-entities/">Next Post Title Â» Â»</a>
```

These symbols are called **[HTML](/support/article/glossary#html) character entities** or **extended characters**. They are generated by strange looking code on the web page that the web browser interprets as symbols.

The code that generated the above example looks like this:

```
<?php previous_post_link('&laquo; &laquo;Â %', '', 'yes');Â ?>
| <?php next_post_link('% &raquo; &raquo; ', '', 'yes');Â ?>
```

Some of the most popular [HTML](/support/article/glossary#html) *character entities* are:

| &amp;raquo; | Â» | double right angle quote |
|---|---|---|
| &amp;laquo; | Â« | double left angle quote |
| &amp;lt; | &lt; | single left arrow (left angle bracket) |
| &amp;gt; | &gt; | single right arrow (right angle bracket) |
| &amp;bull; | â¢ | bullet |
| &amp;# 9829; or &amp;hearts; | â¥ | black heart |
| &amp;# 9830; or &amp;diams; | â¦ | black diamond |
| &amp;# 9827; or &amp;clubs; | â£ | black clubs (shamrock) |
| &amp;# 9824; or &amp;spades; | â  | black spade |
| &amp;# 8734; | â | infinity symbol |
| &amp;mdash; | â | long dash |

Note: Remove Space between â&amp;#â and â9829â for black heart. Other symbols are the same.

## Using Character Entities in WordPress

Using *character entities* can be a fun part of your design! You can use these special accents with [template tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) such as the [the\_category()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_category) tag. Note: [the\_category()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_category) [template tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) lists, in [*post meta data*](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Meta_Data_Section) section, the various [categor](/support/article/glossary#category)[ies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Category) assigned to a [post](/support/article/glossary#post).

In this example, the special *character entity*, the heart (**â¥**) symbol, separates the [categories](/support/article/glossary#category) of WordPress, Computers, and Internet News:

```
<?php the_category(' &hearts; ')Â ?>
```

WordPress â¥ Computers â¥ Internet News

In this example you see the use of an accent in your [postâs title](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_title):

```
<?php the_title('â ', ' â');Â ?> 
```

â WordPress Makes Me Smile â

If you want to highlight the [postâs author](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/the_author), you donât have to use a character entity inside of a WordPress template tag. You can use it in the text.

```
<div id="author">&diams; <?php the_author();Â ?></div>
```

â¦ Harriet Smith

As you have seen, there are a many uses for *character entities* within your site. With this information you can experiment and find creative ways to use these symbols in your design!

**Note:** Not all [template tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) can use *character entities*, especially those [tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) that use [boolean parameters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters#Boolean). Test a [template tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags)   
**thoroughly** to be sure that it will accept the symbols.

# WordPress Housekeeping <a name="documentation/article/wordpress-housekeeping" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-housekeeping/

## Cleaning Your WordPress House

Just as with your house, WordPress requires a little housekeeping once in a while to keep it working right. Here is a list of things you should do on a [regularly scheduled basis](/support/article/wordpress-site-maintenance/) to keep your WordPress site running smoothly.

## Upgrade WordPress

If a new release of WordPress is out, we recommend that you [upgrade](/support/article/updating-wordpress/). These new releases often include [new and improved features](/support/article/wordpress-features/) and fixes. It is recommended to check in with WordPress for updates and upgrades at least every three months, six months at the most. Check [WordPress.org](https://www.wordpress.org/) or [WordPress Downloads](https://www.wordpress.org/downloads) for latest version available.

## Plugins

[Plugins](/support/article/plugins/) are an exciting feature of WordPress. They add functions and features to your WordPress site such as adding customized post listings to featuring a local weather forecast on your site.

With the hundreds of plugins available, itâs fun to test drive them, trying out different ones to see what they will do, if you need them, and if they really add to your site or clutter things up. Once in a while, you should do a little housekeeping on your plugins.

### Upgrade Plugins

Every three to six months, check for the latest plugin version. This is easy to do from the [Administration](/support/article/administration-screens/) &gt; [Plugin](/support/article/administration-screens/#plugins-add-functionality-to-your-blog) Screen. If an update is available, WordPress will notify you with a banner below the plugin. Just click the âupgrade automaticallyâ link, or click the âDownloadâ link if you would prefer to upgrade manually.

[![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/plugins-screen.png?fit=1024%2C655&ssl=1)](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:plugins.png)Administration Plugins Screen

### Delete Old or Unwanted Plugins

To uninstall a WordPress Plugin:

1. Go to **[Plugins](/support/article/administration-screens/#plugins-add-functionality-to-your-blog)** screen.
2. Find the Plugin you wish to deactivate and uninstall.
3. Click Deactivate.
4. Click Delete.

The Plugin will initiate the deactivation and deletion.

Most WordPress Plugins have an option to completely uninstall themselves, though not all. If you wish to remove a WordPress Plugin permanently:

1. Check the WordPress Plugin instructions in the **Details** readme file on how to properly uninstall the Plugin.
2. If the WordPress Plugin required the addition of code to the WordPress Theme, manually edit the Theme files to remove it.
3. Deactivate the Plugin and remove it manually through your FTP program.
    1. Login to the site via your FTP Program.
    2. Go to the Plugin directory and find where the Plugin is installed.
    3. Delete the WordPress Plugin folder and/or files from your server.

### New Plugins

WordPress plugins are being added constantly. Every three to six months search the Internet or visit the [WordPress plugins repository](#plugins) to see if there are any new plugins available that will improve your site. There might be a new plugin that will do what one of your older plugins do.

## Theme Housekeeping

Just like plugins, many users love test driving all the different [WordPress Themes](/support/article/using-themes/) available. Some users might have twenty or more Themes in their theme list. If you arenât using them, why not do a little housekeeping on your themes?

[![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/800px-themes.png)](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:themes.png)Appearance Themes Screen

To remove a theme from your WordPress site:

1. Log in to the WordPress [Administration Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/).
2. Select the [Appearance](/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog) screen then [Themes](/support/article/administration-screens/#themes).
3. Select Theme Details for the theme you want to remove.
4. Select Delete near the bottom-right corner.

### Get a New Theme

Tired of your old themeâs look? Maybe itâs time to do a little presentation housekeeping and change the look of your WordPress site. Thanks to WordPressâs support for [themes](/support/article/using-themes/), changing your siteâs look is easy.

Check out the various resources for [WordPress Themes](/support/article/using-themes/). If you find one you like, install it and then activate it.

Donât worry, your old theme will still be there. Test drive the new one for a while. You can always go back to the old one. If you are really determined to turn your theme housekeeping efforts into some serious work, check out the article on [Theme Development](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/) to create your own unique theme.

## Unwanted Images

Many users upload a lot of graphics to their site that they end up never using. If you find yourself with a lot of unused graphics and images, consider going through them and cleaning house by deleting them.

If you arenât sure you will never need them again, but you arenât using them now and want to remove them from your site if server site space is limited, move them to a folder in your hard drive WordPress folder called *backupimages* or something similar and store them there, *just in case*.

## Database Optimization

Over time, your WordPress database can generate whatâs called âoverhead.â This condition is similar to a defragmented hard drive. There are some plugins that optimize your database (e.g. [WP-Sweep](#pluginswp-sweep/))

## Maintenance Schedule

In the article, [Lessons: WordPress Site Maintenance](/support/article/wordpress-site-maintenance), we cover website maintenance, but take a moment now to go through this list of WordPress housekeeping chores and add them to your calendar so you can clean up your site on a regular basis, keeping your WordPress site a lean and clean site to visit.

**Important:** Please note that this is not a support page. If you seek help with your specific problem, please refer to the [Support forums](#support/welcome).

## Getting a WordPress Tune Up

To keep WordPress working healthy, there is some site maintenance we recommend you do frequently.

Begin by creating a calendar of WordPress Maintenance procedures to remind yourself to get a maintenance job on your WordPress site on a regular basis.

In the article on [WordPress Housekeeping](/support/article/wordpress-housekeeping/), tips and resources are given to clean house in WordPress. These include cleaning out old plugins, upgrading WordPress, and other helpful tips for cleaning up and optimizing your WordPress Site.

To ensure you keep your WordPress site up-to-date and working in prime condition, consider adding these Housekeeping steps to your calendar, typically every three to six months.

## Update WordPress

WordPress is quickly growing and expanding as more features and functions are included and perfected. It is recommended that you check in with WordPress for updates and upgrades at least every three months, six months at the most. Check [WordPress org](#) and [Download WordPress](#download/) for information on the latest version available.

**Note:** For WordPress 3.7+, minor and security updates are automatically applied in the background process.

## Check for Dead Links

One of the most complained about aspect of using the Internet is the *dead link*. This is a link on a page or search engine that goes nowhere. It results in the 4**04 Page Error â Page Not Found**. These can come from links to external sites that have changed their address or closed, or it can come from internal links. When you [link between posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Linking_Posts_Pages_and_Categories) in your post articles, you might have misspelled a [permalink address](/support/article/using-permalinks/) or put in the wrong post-ID, resulting in a **page not found** on your site. If youâve recently made a change in your permalink structure, you might have some **404 page errors** that might need cleaning up.

Add to your WordPress maintenance list regularly scheduled visits to your siteâs statistic logs to check on reports of **404 errors** on your site, and take time to run a links check on your external, and internal, links to make sure everything is still connected. Dependent upon the site and number of links on your site, you should check your site for dead links every six months to a year.

- [KeepNIâs link check (14 day evaluation, $299.00 US)](http://tools.keepni.com/)

## Check In With WordPress

The WordPress [Dashboard](/support/article/administration-screens/#dashboard-information-central), part of the [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/), help to keep you up-to-date on the WordPress Community and activities, but check the [WordPress](#) website to find out if there have been any upgrades, news, events, or information you may need to know as a WordPress user.

If you arenât an active participant in the [WordPress Forums](#support/forums), check in once in a while to see what is going on and what topics are being discussed. There might be a topic that might interest you or news you should know.

Also visit the [WordPress Documentation](/support) here to find out if there is new documentation, events, information, or resources that will help you better run and manage your WordPress site.

## Delete Spam Comments

If you are using one of the many different Comment Spam WordPress Plugins with your WordPress blog, spam can collect in your database. Comment spam is stored in the database as a âjust in caseâ so you can restore a comment incorrectly marked at comment spam. It also serves as a resource to track down recurrent comment spammers, if you need to.

In general, while some plugins will delete comment spam from your database after a specific period of time, not all do. These entries are dead-weight and unnecessary, and they can accumulate. To delete all current comment spam entries run this query on your WordPress database with [phpMyAdmin](/support/article/phpmyadmin/) in the SQL page:

```
DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = 'spam'
```

## Back It Up

Make it a part of your regularly scheduled maintenance to backup your WordPress site, both on the website host server and on your computer. For detailed information see [WordPress Backups](/support/article/wordpress-backups/). Consider scheduling this, depending upon the volume of new posts or articles you add to your site, three to twelve times a year.

[Backing Up Your Database](/support/article/backing-up-your-database/) describes how to save a backup copy of your database tables that contain all your blog data, and [Restoring Your Database From Backup](/support/article/restoring-your-database-from-backup/) guides you through the process of restoring data using one of your backups should you ever have to do so.

## Update Your Site

If you havenât been adding posts or articles lately, make a schedule to remind you to add new material on a regular basis. If you have, then take a look at what youâve posted in the past and maybe do a little checking for proper grammar, bad spelling, information that needs updating, rewriting and editing a little, checking for any adjustments that should be made to make the information youâve released to the public better.

Website looks change with time and maybe you are tired of your old look. It might need a little tweaking to improve its presentation and performance, or maybe itâs time for a new [WordPress Theme](/support/article/using-themes/).

Schedule site updates, depending upon how frequently you post new posts and articles, about every six months so your site will stay fresh and alive.

## Validate Again

Make it a website maintenance policy to [validate your site](https://codex.wordpress.org/Validation) after making any code or style sheet changes. This way, you can keep on top of guaranteeing users wonât run into problems and trouble that might be brewing under the surface.

You can also regularly schedule validation tests on your site to keep it in top working condition and keep up with any changes or deprecations of the [CSS](https://codex.wordpress.org/CSS) and HTML standards. Typically, this should be done about once a year or when you make significant modifications to your site.

## Other Maintenance Tasks

For the serious blogger or website administrator, there are some site maintenance tasks you should do to keep up with your site based on site statistics data so that it improves hit ratio from search engine. Here are some suggestions to keep your site in top shape.

- Check Your Website Statistics : Who is visiting, where they are visiting from, which pages are the most visitedâ¦check in regularly with your website statistics to find out where the action is on your site, where the dead links are, and where users are coming from. This information can help you better fine tune your site to meet the needs of your users and increase your web visibility. You should check site statistics at least monthly if you have an active site.
- Check Your Linkability : There are many *link popularity* tools on the Internet that will check to see who is linking to you. This is part of the puzzle that search engines use to rank your site. Dependent upon your siteâs activity and need to grow in search engine rankings, this should be done monthly, or at least three times a year.
- Site Submissions : If you have a desire to make your site rise in search engine rankings, regularly schedule activity surrounding your siteâs submissions to search engines and attracting new users. Take care to limit your submissions to the same search engine too frequently, as that can penalize you, but check in with your site submissions once or twice a year at a minimum.
- Update Advertising : If you have included advertising in your site, check with your advertisers on a regular basis to make sure they havenât changed their techniques, pricing, and process. Dependent upon site activity, this could be as often as once a month or several times a year.

# Weblog client <a name="documentation/article/weblog-client" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/weblog-client/

A Weblog Client is software you run on your local machine (desktop) that lets you post to your blog via [XML-RPC](https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support). In some cases, the Weblog Client can even manage your weblog entries. You might think of Weblog Clients as the equivalent of email clients. Essentially, the Weblog Client allows you to write a post even if you are off-line; then, the next time you connect to the Internet, you can publish that post.

For information on blogging by email, see [Blog by Email](https://codex.wordpress.org/Blog_by_Email).

## Advantages

The advantages of using a weblog client include:

1. The ability to write posts without having to go on-line
2. The ability to save drafts

# Protect posts with password <a name="documentation/article/protect-posts-with-password" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/protect-posts-with-password/

## Post Visibility Settings

Once you publish a WordPress post (or Page), it is visible to the public (by default). In WordPress terms, this means a post with a *Published* status has a default visibility of *Public*, based on the settings in the [Publish box](/support/article/writing-posts/#post-field-descriptions) of a [Edit Post Screen](/support/article/administration-screens/#posts-make-some-content).

WordPress also offers two less public options for your postâs [Content Visibility](https://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Visibility). Clicking the âEditâ link next to **Visibility: Public** reveals three radio buttons:

- *Public* is selected by default.
- Checking *Password protected* reveals a text field for entering a password, that will be required to view that post. **The password is limited to 20 characters.**
- Checking *Private* makes your post visible only to your siteâs Users with the role of [Administrator or Editor](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/).[](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:protected_edit.png)Visibility Settings

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/protected_edit.png)

When youâre done editing the postâs visibility, click the âOKâ button. You should now see your postâs new setting, e.g., **Visibility: Password Protected.**Remember: a setting change does not take effect until you click the âPublishâ button (or âUpdateâ if the post is already published.)

## Finding or Changing a Password

Only an Administrator, Editor, or the postâs Author can change a postâs password or visibility setting. To do so, use the âVisibility: Editâ link again. These settings are also available using the postâs Quick Edit link in the All Posts Screen.

The **Visibility** âEditâ link (or âQuick Editâ) is also a good way to reveal a forgotten post password.

## Password Protected Posts

[![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/protected_password.png)](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:protected_password.png)

WordPress displays a password-protected post differently. It makes these changes to the postâs:

- **Titleâ** Adds the text âProtected: â before the post Title.
- **Excerptâ** Instead of the post Excerpt, prints this text: âThere is no excerpt because this is a protected post.â
- **Contentâ** Instead of the post Content, prints a password form with this text: âThis post is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:â

[![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/protected_content.png)](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:protected_content.png)So, a password-protected post with a title of âMy Postâ would display like this:

### Password Protecting Many Posts and Pages

WordPress stores this password in a browser cookie so readers donât have to re-enter passwords if they visit the same page multiple times. Furthermore, if multiple posts use the same password, the reader will only have to enter the password once to access every post (see caveat below).

WordPress will only track one password at a time. Therefore, if two posts use two different passwords, entering the password for post A, then entering the password for post B means that revisiting post A (or any post which shares its password) will require the user to re-enter the password for post A.

## Protect Custom Fields

WordPress does not print a password-protected postâs Content or Excerpt until the correct password is entered. But a postâs [Custom Field(s)](/support/article/custom-fields/) data is not protected, and can still show. To stop CFs from printing, wrap your [get\_post\_meta](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta) calls (e.g., in single.php or page.php) with a conditional statement using: [post\_password\_required](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/post_password_required). This one WordPress function checks both whether your post requires a password and whether the correct password has been provided:

```
<?php
if (Â ! post_password_required() ) {
    // Code to fetch and print CFs, such as:
    $key_1_value_1 = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'key_1', true );
        echo $key_1_value_1;
}
?>
```

The post\_password\_required function within in an if statement is also handy for other customizations, such as preventing password-protected posts from displaying in a list.

## Customize the Protected Text

With [WordPress Filters](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference) you can: change the default text in the password form, change the default text for the password-protected post Excerpt, and insert the password form into the post Excerpt. To do so, add the following code to your custom plugin file.

### Password Form Text

The password form displays this default message: âThis post is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:â The following code will return the form with different text and different html structure â in this example the custom message is: âTo view this protected post, enter the password below:â

```
<?php
function my_password_form() {
    global $post;
    $label = 'pwbox-'.( empty( $post->ID )Â ? rand()Â : $post->ID );
    $o = '<form action="' . esc_url( site_url( 'wp-login.php?action=postpass', 'login_post' ) ) . '" method="post">
    ' . __( "To view this protected post, enter the password below:" ) . '
    <label for="' . $label . '">' . __( "Password:" ) . ' </label><input name="post_password" id="' . $label . '" type="password" size="20" maxlength="20" /><input type="submit" name="Submit" value="' . esc_attr__( "Submit" ) . '" />
    </form>
    ';
    return $o;
}
add_filter( 'the_password_form', 'my_password_form' );
?>
```

Please note: the my\_password\_form function must return a value: donât use print or echo.

#### Password Size Limitation

Make sure to set the maxlength parameter to a value of 20 when replacing the password protection form as WordPress will only save the first 20 characters due to database constraints.

### Protected Excerpt Text

The default Excerpt of a password-protected post is: âThere is no excerpt because this is a protected post.â This code will replace that text with your own â HTML allowed:

```
<?php
function my_excerpt_protected( $excerpt ) {
    if ( post_password_required() )
        $excerpt = '<em>[This is password-protected.]</em>';
    return $excerpt;
}
add_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'my_excerpt_protected' );
?>
```

Replace â&lt;em&gt;\[This is password-protected.\]&lt;/em&gt;â with your custom password-protected Excerpt message.

### Add the Password Form to the Excerpt

Another option for your protected Excerpts is to print out the password form instead of the Excerpt message. That way people enter the password right from an index or archive page. Then, when they click the Title link, theyâll see the Content. With the get\_the\_password\_form function, you can make the password form be the Excerpt for a password-protected post:

```
<?php
function my_excerpt_password_form( $excerpt ) {
    if ( post_password_required() )
        $excerpt = get_the_password_form();
    return $excerpt;
}
add_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'my_excerpt_password_form' );
?>
```

This will get the default WordPress password form and text or [any customizations](#password-form-text) youâve made. For a better understanding of how post\_password\_required() and get\_the\_password\_form() work, read their function definitions in `<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/5.1.0/src/wp-includes/post-template.php#L0">wp-includes/post-template.php</a>`.

In this same WordPress core file youâll also find the the\_excerpt and the\_password\_form filters, and the functions [get\_the\_excerpt()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_the_excerpt), [get\_the\_title()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_the_title), and [get\_the\_content()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_the_content). These functions control how a postâs title, excerpt and content display, depending on its visibility setting.

## Hiding Password Protected Posts

Sometimes, you donât want your password protected posts to show up on other places around your site, like on the home page or archive pages. To effectively hide them from these pages without affecting your pagination, place the following code in your custom plugin file:

```
<?php

// Filter to hide protected posts
function exclude_protected($where) {
	global $wpdb;
	return $where .= " AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_password = '' ";
}

// Decide where to display them
function exclude_protected_action($query) {
	if(Â !is_single() &&Â !is_page() &&Â !is_admin() ) {
		add_filter( 'posts_where', 'exclude_protected' );
	}
}

// Action to queue the filter at the right time
add_action('pre_get_posts', 'exclude_protected_action');

?>
```

This code works in two parts: the first part effectively removes any password protected posts directly from any SQL query that WordPress is running, using the [posts\_where filter](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/posts_where). The second part adds this filter to all pages except single posts, pages, and admin pages.

For more information on why pre\_get\_posts is the right action for this function, see the [pre\_get\_posts action reference](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/pre_get_posts).

# What are Emoji? <a name="documentation/article/what-are-emoji" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-emoji/

## Introduction to Emoji

Emoji are the ideograms or smileys ð used in electronic messages and Web pages. Originating in Japan on mobile devices, they are now commonly available on devices worldwide, ranging from mobile to desktop computers.

Different operating systems have distinct methods of accessing emoji. Note that these methods work in most applications, not just WordPress.

### Emoji are not Smileys

Not quite. Emoji are a newer development than smileys (a.k.a. emoticons). They are created differently, and handled differently by operating systems and web browsers. For more information about smileys, please see the [Using Smileys](/support/article/using-smilies/) page.

## Using Emoji on Mobile

### iOS (iPhones, iPads, etc. running iOS 5 and higher)

Follow these instructions to turn the Emoji keyboard on (as of iOS 8 it is enabled by default):

1. Go into the Settings app
2. Select âGeneralâ
3. Select âKeyboardsâ
4. Tap the Keyboard button, then âAdd New Keyboardâ
5. Scroll down and select âEmojiâ

After youâve done this, you will now see a small âsmiley faceâ icon to the left of the space bar when typing. (If you have multiple keyboards enabled, you may see a globe icon instead.) Tap on this to switch to the Emoji keyboard.

### Android

There is a smiley face button in the lower right corner of the keyboard. Tap this to access emoji.

[![](https://wordpress.org/support/files/2019/02/714px-AndroidKeyboard.jpg)](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:AndroidKeyboard.jpeg)In some apps, you may need to tap and hold the Enter button for the smiley face button to appear.

[![](https://wordpress.org/support/files/2019/02/721px-AndroidKeyboard2.jpg)](https://codex.wordpress.org/File:AndroidKeyboard2.jpeg)## Using Emoji on Desktops

### Windows 10

1. In Desktop mode, right-click the Taskbar
2. Click to check the option that says âShow touch keyboard buttonâ

A new icon will appear in the taskbar (lower right hand corner of the screen near the time) that looks like a keyboard. Click the keyboard icon to open the onscreen keyboard, you can then click the smiley face to open the emojis.

### Windows 8

To access emoji in Windows, you have to perform a one-time setup first.

1. In Desktop mode, right-click the Taskbar
2. Select âToolbarsâ
3. Select âTouch Keyboardâ

A new icon will appear in the System Tray (lower right corner of your screen) that looks like a keyboard.

After that, when you want to type an emoji, just click on that icon and an onscreen keyboard will appear. Click the smiley face next to the space bar, and the alphanumeric keyboard will change to an emoji keyboard.

### Mac OS X (10.7 or higher)

1. Click the Edit menu
2. Select âSpecial Charactersâ
3. A small popup keyboard will appear allowing access to emoji and many other special characters.

You can also access this popup by pressing â-control-space.

### Linux

The Symbola font enables emoji display under Linux applications. Installing this font depends on your distribution.

#### Arch Linux

Itâs found in the ttf-symbola package under Arch Linux and its derivatives. Installing it is a one-shot command :

```
sudo pacman -S ttf-symbola
```

#### Debian

You need to install it manually under Debian :

1. Create a custom fonts dir and go into it : mkdir ~/.fonts &amp;&amp; cd ~/.fonts
2. Download Symbola.ttf from a font site (many links possible) using wget; eventually uncompress it if delivered as a ZIP our gzipped file.
3. Let the magic begin !

#### Fedora

Itâs available in the yum repositories, again one commandline from using it :

```
sudo yum install gdouros-symbola-fonts
```

## Converting to images

For backwards compatibility there are wp-emoji.js and twemoji.js JavaScript files being used. They will convert the often greyscale Emoji characters to colored image files.

If you are a developer working on forms, you might want to disable this behaviour in your input fields and textareas. You can use the class attribute with âwp-exclude-emojiâ for this.

## Common Emoji

Beyond the standard emoticon-type âsmileysâ, (e.g. ð or ð¢) there are hundreds of emoji, ranging from plants and animals (ð±, ð´, ð¹) to people (ð«, ð), objects (ð¥, ð), vehicles (ð), food (ð), the Sun and Moon, and more.

# Use image and file attachments <a name="documentation/article/use-image-and-file-attachments" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-image-and-file-attachments/

In WordPress you can upload, store, and display a variety of file types (media). The most common file types are image, video and audio files, but other file types such as document files, spreadsheet files, and code samples (amongst others) can also be managed within WordPress.

Media can be uploaded via the [Media Add New Screen](#documentation/article/media-add-new-screen) or [Media Library Screen](#documentation/article/media-library-screen) in the admin area, or via quick links on the edit screen.

In order to upload media, you may need to ensure that the correct [file permissions](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/server/file-permissions/) are set for the wp-content directory in your WordPress installation.

## Edit Screen Links

By default, above the post editing area is a link to Upload/Insert media in to the post.

## Attachment to a Post

If a media file is uploaded within the edit screen, it will automatically be attached to the current post being edited. If it is uploaded via the   
 [Media Add New Screen](#documentation/article/media-add-new-screen) or [Media Library Screen](#documentation/article/media-library-screen) it will be unattached, but may become attached to a post when it is inserted into post. There also is an option on the [Media Library Screen](#documentation/article/media-library-screen) to attach unattached media items.

Note that media items are also âPostsâ in their own right and can be displayed as such via the WordPress [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/). Themes can make use of this to loop over media items or create galleries.

If the parent post of an attached media item is deleted, the media item will become attached to the deleted postâs parent if it exists or if it doesnât exist, the media item will become unattached and is open for re-attachment to another post.

## Inserting in a Post

Once a media file has been uploaded, it may be [inserted in to a post](#documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages-block-editor).

When the media file is inserted you can choose to:

- Link directly to the media file
- Link to the attachment post, in which case the file will be served via the WordPress [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/)
- Not link to the media file (e.g. in the case of images, the image file will still be embedded in the page, but not linked to allow the browser to display the image file by itself)

## Usage in Themes

Themes may use various template tags to display post attachments or utilize the [attachment.php](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) file to customize the display of attachments. A [shortcode](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/media/galleries/#gallery-shortcode) tag is also available to display a gallery of images attached to a post.

# Comment moderation <a name="documentation/article/comment-moderation" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comment-moderation/

Comment moderation is a feature in WordPress that allows you to prevent comments from appearing on your site without your express approval. Moderation can be very useful in addressing [Comment Spam](/support/article/comment-spam), but it has more general applications as well. If you would like to learn more about comment spam, see [Fighting Comment Spam](#documentation/article/comment-spam).

## How moderation works

WordPress runs a number of tests on each new comment before posting it to your blog. If a comment fails one of these tests, it is not displayed immediately on the site but is placed in a queue for **moderation**, the process of manual approval or deletion by the blogâs administrator.

## Controlling moderation

You can control which comments get held for moderation on your [Settings Discussion Screen](/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/) page, which is located under [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) â [Discussion](/support/article/administration-screens/#discussion).

If you would like every comment to be held for moderation, check the **Comment must be manually approved** option, listed under **Before a comment appears**.

If you would like to send suspicious comments to the moderation queue, while letting innocent comments through, you will need to specify a set of rules for determining which comments are suspicious. These rules are specified in on the [Settings](#documentation/article/administration-screens) â [Discussion](#documentation/article/administration-screens) &gt; Comment Moderation.

The first option is to hold comments for moderation if they contain an unusually large number of hyperlinks. Most normal comments contain at most one or two links while spam comments often have a large number. Look at your own comments and set this to a value that makes sense for your audience. (Note: In version 1.5.2, and possibly others, if you do not put a number in the comment moderation links box, in other words, if this box is completely blank, all anonymous comments (and possibly others) are sent to the Manage Comments SubPanel for moderation, even if the Discussion Options Subpanel has no restrictions set.)

The second option is to specify a set of **moderation keys** which, if present in any part of the comment, will cause it to be held for moderation. These keys are specified one per line in the large text area, which is blank by default. Moderation keys can include Spam Words, swear words, [IP addresses](/support/article/glossary#ip-address), and [Regular Expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).

When you add a new moderation key, itâs a good idea to test its validity by checking previous comments. Simply use the link entitled **Check past comments against moderation list**, which is located underneath the text box containing moderation keys. This asks WordPress to check previous comments and tell you which ones would be flagged for moderation under your new set of keys.

Of course this means that there may be a lot of comments that you donât want on your site caught in the moderation queue, and in this case weâve tried to make it as easy as possible to manage large numbers of comments quickly. See the articles on [Fighting Comment Spam](#documentation/article/comment-spam) for more information and resources.

## Comment blocking

The box marked **Disallowed Comment Keys** works in exactly the same way as the comment moderation box, except that comments that match these words will be **deleted immediately** and ***without notification***. So be careful! Genuine comments could be deleted without you ever knowing they were there.

## Managing incoming comments

Once you start receiving comments on your site, you can check the status of comments quickly by looking at the dashboard, the admin bar, or the left navigation menu. When you log in, the dashboardâs âActivityâ box will show you the status of your comments. Hover over a comment to see your moderation options. From âActivity â Commentsâ you can approve, reply, edit, mark as spam, or trash comments. Alternatively, you can look to see if there is a number next to the comment bubble in the admin bar or âCommentsâ in the left navigation. This number represents how many pending comments require your attention.

### Moderating comments with the comment screen

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/comment_pending_numbered_smaller.png)WordPress makes moderating your usersâ comments a simple process. The [Comments Screen](#documentation/article/comments-screen) lays out the basic information about each comment and lets you decide what to do with it.

1. <a href="">Commenter Gravatar</a>
2. Commenter Name
3. Commenter Website URL
4. Commenter Email Address
5. Commenter IP Address
6. <a href="">Time and Date</a> Comment was submitted
7. Comment Text
8. Comment Moderation Options. You can approve, spam or trash a comment with one click. Reply, Quick Edit or Edit will open up a new screen for you to write a reply to the comment or edit the comment.
9. Post Name

# Understand comment spam <a name="documentation/article/understand-comment-spam" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/understand-comment-spam/

If youâve been on the internet for any amount of time youâre probably familiar with âspamâ in your email inbox. For the uninitiated, spam is an unsolicited commercial message, or something you didnât ask for trying to sell you something.

So what does this have to do with blogs? Well just like you can get spam messages in your inbox, people will leave spam comments on your blog. However unlike email spam where the target is you, comment spam generally targets search engines.

## Comment Spam and Search Engines

Why on earth would a spammer use your blog to target a search engine? Letâs start from the beginning. Several years ago, Google pioneered a search technique called [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank). Basically, in addition to looking at the content of the page being indexed, Google also takes into account who links to the page and what those links say. This technology meant Google was very good at returning relevant results, making it the most popular search engine today. Because their ranking system relies so heavily on PageRank, people sometimes game the system using a technique called âGoogle Bombing.â

A [google bomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb) is when a large number of different websites link to a page with the same link text to influence the ranking of that page for a search term.

This brings us back to the spammers. A spammer might have a site that sells âmydrugâ and wants to be at the top of search results for âmydrugâ on Google. They leave comments on hundreds or thousands of weblogs linking to their site with the link text âmydrug.â They donât really care if you see their google bomb textâin fact theyâd rather you didnât in case you decide to delete it! They just want the search engine to see it when they index your page.

## Fighting Comment Spam

[Comment Moderation](/support/article/comment-moderation/) is very effective in addressing unwanted comments. The best defense against comment spam is just watching your comments. Under `Manage <span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-exclude-emoji">â</span> Comments` it shows a listing of the latest comments on any post and you can quickly scan the comment activity on your site. The faster you respond to comment spam on your site, the less likely the spammers will return.

## Stealth Spam

Spammers find new and creative ways to be sneaky all the time. You may notice that posters leave comments on your site which look perfectly normal except for the commenterâs name or URL, which likely references a product or a site selling something.

Itâs good practice to visit the URLs of people who leave comments on your blog to determine whether the poster is sincere or spammy. If you see one that looks suspicious, you can choose to delete the comment entirely or leave the comment and just delete the URL.

Another way of stealth is to use a div-tag around a bundle of hundreds of links. This becomes more and more common because many software displays directly the given HTML tags and not the HTML code. To avoid this the software must âstrip-outâ, other word: filter the HTML tags while inserting the comment into the database.

## FAQ

Why are they spamming me?Apart from *because they can*, the need to raise page ranking in search engines gives rise to the need to create a lot of links to a web page so the search engine thinks that page is important.

Where can I find WordPress anti-spam plugins?[Plugins for handling comment spam](#plugins/tags/anti-spam) can be found in the [Official WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins).

Which is the best plugin?This is not an easy answer. Spammers use different tactics, and each plugin will use different tactics in response. There is no plugin that will keep you spam-free forever. Comment spammers can download the plugins, see how they work, and figure out a way around them.

Check plugin authorsâ sites for updates. WordPress makes it easy to find updates via the [Plugins screen](#documentation/article/plugins-screen) and the link to the plugin authorâs website.

Comment spam technology is changing fast on both sides, so keep updated with the latest news on comment spam techniques and WordPress Plugin options.

I have a problem with a pluginVisit the plugin authorâs site to see if they have already offered a solution, and if they offer support directly. If not, **search the forums first** before posting as the answer may be there. If there is no answer, then post a support request on that pluginâs support forum.

What happens to comments that are marked as âSpamâ?Comments that are marked as \[spam\] will be held in your database to educate âintelligentâ anti-spam plugins, such as [Akismet](https://akismet.com/).

I have spam appear as soon as I post!If you do not have comment spam plugins or the [latest version of WordPress](#download) installed, this may happen. [Upgrade](#documentation/article/updating-wordpress) or install one of the comment spam plugins and manually delete the comment spam from your [Manage &gt; Comments](#documentation/article/administration-screens) panel.

Why is every comment going into the moderation queue?Go to the [Settings &gt; Discussion](#documentation/article/administration-screens) panel and make sure that **An administrator must approve the comment (regardless of any matches below)** is unchecked. With that option selected, all comments are sent to the moderation queue to await approval. Make sure that **Hold a comment in the queue if it contains more than x links** is not blank and contains a number higher than zero. If this value is blank or zero, all comments containing links will be moderated. If the option mentioned above is unchecked, the link moderation value is higher than zero, and you still have this problem, your Spam Words list probably has blank lines, punctuation marks, or single letters between the information in the list. There should be spaces between the listed items or each item must be on its own line. If you have done this, then upgrade the comment spam plugins you have installed. If this continues to be a problem, deactivate the comment spam plugins one by one to determine the culprit and contact the plugin author for help.

I have disabled comments, but comments continue to be postedIf you have unchecked **Allow people to post comments on the article** on the [Options &gt; Discussion](#documentation/article/administration-screens) panel, then you have only disabled comments on *future posts*. To completely disable comments, you will have to edit each past post and uncheck **Allow Comments**. Alternatively, you could delete the wp-comments-post.php file, or run this MySQL query, from the command line on a shell account, or using [phpMyAdmin](https://codex.wordpress.org/phpMyAdmin): `UPDATE wp_posts SET comment_status="closed";`

I have disabled trackbacks, but trackbacks continue to be postedIf you have unchecked **Allow link notifications from other Weblogs (pingbacks and trackbacks.)** on the Options &gt; Discussion panel, then you have only disabled trackbacks on *future posts*. To completely disable trackbacks, you will have to edit each past post and uncheck **Allow Pings** from the Write Post SubPanel. Alternatively, you could just simply delete the wp-trackback.php file, or run this MySQL query, from the command line on a shell account, or using PHPMyAdmin: `UPDATE wp_posts SET ping_status="closed";`

# WordPress Block Editor <a name="documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor/

The WordPress block editor also called the **block editor**, **WordPress editor** or **Gutenberg** **editor** is the new way of publishing content in WordPress.

Following the launch of WordPress 5.0 in December 2018, the WordPress block editor was set as the default editor and replaced the [classic editor](#documentation/article/writing-posts). To use the [classic editor](#documentation/article/writing-posts), you will need to install the [classic editor](#plugins/classic-editor) plugin.

The WordPress block editor offers an array of [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) that can be used to create media-rich pages and posts.

[Blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) are the content elements that you add to create content layouts. You can add [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) for paragraphs, images, headings, lists, videos, galleries, and more. You can control the layout of the blocks with ease, to build visually appealing web pages.

WordPress has blocks for all common content elements, and more can be added through [WordPress plugins](#plugins/browse/blocks).

[Visit the Gutenberg demo website to try the Block Editor.](#gutenberg)

## The block editorâs workspace

To launch the WordPress block editor, click on **Posts** &gt; **Add New** or **Pages** &gt; **Add New**.

# Blocks list <a name="documentation/article/blocks-list" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks-list/

Blocks are the components for adding content in the new [WordPress block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor). There are several blocks available within WordPress that you can easily [add](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block) to your post or page, [move](#documentation/article/moving-blocks) within a post or page and [search for](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block#searching-for-blocks).

There are different ways to configure and [work with these blocks](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks). You can also install additional third party blocks from the [WordPress block directory](#documentation/article/block-directory).

Below is a list of the blocks that are currently available within WordPress. We will be adding to this list as more blocks are added with each release.

The Block Inserter categorizes the blocks into 6 different types: Text, Media, Design, Widgets, Theme and Embeds.

# Paragraph block <a name="documentation/article/paragraph-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/paragraph-block/

[Go back to the list of Blocks](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Paragraph* block is a basic building block that allows you to add text content to a post or page. It is the default block that appears when you create a new post or page.

Besides adding text, the *Paragraph* block offers various formatting options to customize text content. It lets you make the text bold, italics, and strikethrough. Additionally, you can add links, inline images, and highlights to the text content.

The *Paragraph* block also supports keyboard shortcuts for text formatting, making creating and customizing content easier. For example, you can convert texts into headings using keyboard shortcuts: **Alt + Shift + Number 1-6**. The numerical keyboard shortcuts represent Heading 1 to Heading 6. If you want to change them back to texts, press **Alt + Shift + 0**.

[Learn more about the text formatting keyboard shortcuts.](#documentation/article/keyboard-shortcuts-block-editor)

To add a *Paragraph* block, create a new post or page and open the Block Inserter tool. Look for the *Paragraph* block using the search bar and click on the icon to insert the block into the editor.

You can also choose the *Paragraph* block from the âBlock Inserterâ (+) pop-up window when you click on the (+) sign.

### Adding an image

The media options panel will load with three options, *Upload*, *Media Library*, and *Insert from URL*.

![There are three ways to add images - Upload, Media Library, and Insert from URL.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/292768014-ccdab762-350a-45e4-8031-72f14ad7766c.png)There are three ways to add images â Upload, Media Library, and Insert from URL.Upload and Media Library will let you add or choose media from your library and embed it in your page.

Simply add the image from the Upload Files tab, then select it in the Media Library tab. Customizing the image attachment details, such as the Title, Caption, Alt Text, and Description, in the Media Library window can also be helpful for SEO and future navigation of your media library.

![Upload or select an image from your Media Library, add image information, then press Select.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/292768016-cd56a1c7-5958-47fa-ab52-392ca8fbff32-1024x683.png)Upload or select an image from your Media Library, add image information, then press Select.It is, also, possible to drop image into empty paragraph.

As well as choosing an image from [Openverse](https://openverse.org/en-gb), which will be uploaded to your siteâs Media.

Images can also be dragged from inserter to existing image block.

#### Importing external images

If you selected the âInsert from URL optionâ to add your image, you will see a button with an upward facing arrow. If you click on it, the image will be imported into your siteâs local Media Library and the URL on the image block will be automatically updated to point at the new file.

Setting the image via an external URL and then importing it to the local Media Library.If the imported image has a caption, it will be added automatically as well.

Please note that the âUpload External Imageâ feature might not work on all websites, as some of them restrict how their images are handled.

### Resizing images

Once the image is added to the editor, you can resize and align the images to better fit the surrounding content.

Resize an image by dragging its handles.To resize an image,

- Click on the image to reveal the draggable resize handles.
- Click on the resize handles and drag the image to your desired size.

Alternatively, on the right-hand side in the Block Settings, the image size can be fine-tuned by adjusting width and height dimensions. There are also some convenient options in the block settings for setting the image to 100, 75, 50, and 25% of its original size.

### Aligning images

Align an image within a paragraph block.If you wish to align an image within a paragraph you will first need to insert the image *just above the target paragraph block.*

![Alignment buttons with Align left highlighted](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/292768021-bc7359b8-c035-4fa5-907f-c08e70f264f5.png)Alignment buttons with Align left highlightedFrom there, click on the image and select left or right alignment, this will merge the image into the paragraph block.

Finally, resize the image to your desired width and height.

### Wide and Full width images

As support for the new editor is added to our themes, you will begin seeing icons for Wide and Full Width images. These two image sizes will allow you to expand the image beyond the themeâs usual content width.

A âWideâ image in the editor.### Captions

If you wish to add a caption to a singular instance of an image, simply type it in the caption space below the image in the editor.

### Link settings

The link settings allow you to hyperlink your images. You may choose for clicking on the image to open an attachment page, the original media file, or a custom URL of your choice.

![Your image can link to an Attachment Page, Media File, or Custom URL.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/292768022-6969ee5e-e621-426d-b27b-cd1c2e759d3f.png)Your image can link to an Attachment Page, Media File, or Custom URL.### Image editing

A new feature allows you to make quick crops without leaving the editor. Just hit the *Crop* button in the toolbar.

An expanded toolbar will appear. This will allow you to zoom an image.

![Image toolbar showcasing the zoom option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/292769877-cb010416-ecd1-4a43-8a03-85b33bdb297e.png)Image toolbar showcasing the zoom optionThere are also options to set the aspect ratio, such as to crop the image into a square.

![Image showing the cropping tools for an Image block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/292769878-35c519aa-d9e9-4600-a704-9e95151fa8d2.png)Image showing the cropping tools for an Image block.You can also rotate the image if it comes in sideways.

After you make any changes, click Apply.

### Adding text overlay

A new feature allows you to convert image block to cover block so that you can add overlay text on the image.

![Image showing the option to add text over the image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/8.png)Image showing the option to add text over the imageUpon clicking the *Add text over image* button the block transforms immediately to a cover block with its placeholder paragraph.

![Add text over image placeholder ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/292768025-50ce9264-22a7-487e-b46a-e9e955b532ec.png)Add text over image placeholderSometimes you use a tool like Google Docs to write or collaborate on posts. When youâre ready to put the content on your site, you may copy and paste them into the editor.

One problem is that those images are likely hosted somewhere else like Google and could easily become broken if a change is made.

So, If you copy and paste an image from a resource like Google Docs, a button will appear on the toolbar to upload it to the media library. Click that, and it will stay in the post, but also upload to your media library.

### More options

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

HTML anchor allows you to do â[page jumping](#documentation/article/page-jumps)â to that specific image. Page jumping, also sometimes referred to as anchor links, is where you click a link and instantly get moved somewhere further up or down a long page.

To enable this, you put an HTML Anchor in your photo, and create a link that jumps to the anchor.

The advanced tab also lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

![Sidebar icon to display the Block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/image-1.png)Sidebar icon to display the Block settings### For the Gallery block

#### Columns

![Gallery block settings panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/2024-01-16_15-30.png)Showing settings for the Gallery blockYou can choose how many columns your Gallery block can have.

Select between 1 column and 8 columns. Keep in mind that you can only select as many columns as you have images.

This means that if you add 4 images, youâll be given the option for a maximum of 4 columns. This number will increase as you add more images until you reach the maximum of 8. Even if you add more images to the Gallery, you will not be able to add more than 8 columns.

Your images will automatically arrange themselves to look good no matter how many columns you select. Try changing the setting and see what you like best.

To change the setting you can either manually enter the number of columns you want or visually change the number by using the slider to drag the number up and down.

#### Crop images

You can select whether or not youâd like all of your images to be cropped in your Gallery block.

This option is useful if you have images of varying sizes and shapes. Cropping them will make the images in each row of the gallery the same size. You can toggle this option on and off to see which way you prefer.

#### Link to

You have 3 options for linking the images in your gallery: Attachment Page, Media File, and None. This determines what happens when your visitors click on the images in your gallery. You can also add custom links for each image from the block toolbar of the selected image.

- **Attachment page**: Selecting this option will link the image to its WordPress media [attachment](#documentation/article/inserting-images-into-posts-and-pages) page. This is an informational page about your image, which includes the image, the caption, the image description, and a comment field.
- **Media file**: Selecting this option will link the image to the image file in the original size in a new browser window.
- **None**: Selecting this option will not link the image to anything.

#### Image sizes

The *Image Size* setting allows you to set all the images to the size you choose.

- **Thumbnail:** Displays a small thumbnail-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note, by default the Thumbnail size is a square, so some cropping of your original image may occur.
- **Medium:** Displays a medium-sized version of your image on the page/post. This is a good size to use with Left/Right alignments, as it leaves sufficient space for legible text to either side.
- **Large**: Displays a large-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space.
- **Full Size:** Displays a full-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space. If your original image is larger than this column width, the full size of the image may not be displayed.

*Note: *For these images sizes to work, your theme needs to support them.**

#### Style Settings 

You can access the Style settings for the Gallery and Image block by clicking on the Styles tab.

![The styles tab on the gallery block's settings panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/2024-01-16_15-33.png)Accessing style settings for a block#### Color

#### Advanced settings

[![The advanced section on the gallery block's settings panel](#documentation/files/2024/01/2024-01-16_15-34.png)](#documentation/files/2024/01/2024-01-16_15-34.png)The âAdvancedâ tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.Block Name field lets you add a name for the gallery, which will appear on the editorâs list view. That will help you to navigate the list view and find the right block easier.

HTML anchor allows you to do â[page jumping](#documentation/article/page-jumps)â to the gallery. Page jumping, also sometimes referred to as anchor links, is where you click a link and instantly get moved somewhere further up or down a long page.

To enable this, you put an HTML anchor in the Advanced settings in the Gallery block. You can then create a link to this anchor anywhere on the page and it scrolls to the Gallery block.

The advanced tab also lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

### For images in the gallery 

#### Image settings

![The image settings panel for the image inside a gallery block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/image-3.png)For each image in the gallery, add alternative text to help with accessibility. ALT text can describe the purpose of the image. Leave the ALT text field empty if the image is purely decorative.

#### Resolution

The *Resolution* setting allows you to set the image size for individual images in the gallery. You can choose between Thumbnail, Medium, Large and Full size.

Thereâs also the *Expand on click* toggle to enable the lightbox feature. This will let visitors to enlarge the image into its full size by clicking on the image.

*Note: *For these image sizes to work, your theme needs to support them.**

#### Styles 

You can vary the styles of the images in the Gallery block by choosing the Styles settings. You have two different style options in the block sidebar, when you select an image.

![Styles for images within the gallery](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/image-4.png)Styles settings for images within the gallery#### Filter options

You can create a filter effect on images without actually changing the original image.

The filter option allows you to add this filter color to your block content from the block toolbar.

#### Border

The Gallery block provides border settings options to add border color, width, and radius.

The Title attribute field is designed to describe the [role of the image on your page](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/dom.html#the-title-attribute). Many devices and browsers donât display this text.

HTML anchor allows you to do â[page jumping](#documentation/article/page-jumps)â to that specific image. Page jumping, also sometimes referred to as anchor links, is where you click a link and instantly get moved somewhere further up or down a long page.

To enable this, you put an HTML Anchor in your photo and create a link that jumps to the anchor.

The advanced tab also lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the image as you choose.

*Note: Based on which style you choose for the image block in the [Styles settings](#styles-settings), WordPress automatically adds a CSS class to the image block under Additional CSS class(es). You can add additional classes with spaces.*

# Heading block <a name="documentation/article/heading-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/heading-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

Headings help to introduce new sections and organize the content on the page. They make your website more readable by humans and search engines.

To add a heading, click on the **Block Inserter** (**+**). Alternatively, you can type `/heading` in a new paragraph block and press `enter`.

You can also add a Heading block with **H1** heading level by typing `/h1` in a new paragraph block followed by `enter`. Subsequent heading blocks can be added by typing `/h2`, `/h3`, `/h4`, `/h5`, `/h6` followed by `enter`.

The Block editor by default considers the page title as the &lt;h1&gt; tag, so subsequent **Heading** blocks are added as **H2**, **H3**, and so on.

You can also choose your heading level according to your style from the Block Toolbar.

![Changing the heading levels in the Heading block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-22-at-9.18.34-AM.png)Another shortcut method to add a heading is to type `##space` to add **H2** heading, `###space` to add **H3** heading, etc.

A fixed background means the cover image scrolls along with your page. Turning this option off embeds the image in place, so the image doesnât scroll.

#### Repeated background

![Repeated background settings for the cover image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/Screenshot-repeated123.png)The **Repeated background** option lets you repeat the same image to form a pattern in the Cover block.

Click on the picker to drag it to the spot you want, or use the left and top position percentages below to set it manually.

The clear media button removes the media and any changes you have to it.

#### Alternative text

The alternative text field allows you to add an alternative text for the cover image.

### Color

![The color settings for the cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/image-8.png)With the Color settings, you can customize the **Cover** block by adding text, background, and link colors. The color selections vary depending on your active theme.

You can also add a gradient color to the **Cover** block. To do that, transform the block into the Media &amp; Text block. Click the Background option and select the Gradient tab. Choose a color from the list. Convert the Media &amp; Text block back into the **Cover** block.

![When you type /audio the editor suggest adding an audio block, a SoundCloud, Spotify, Mixcloud or Pocket Casts embed.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/audio-block-select-WP-62-2.png)Use the slash command /audio to insert an *audio block.*[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

## Block Interface

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and block-specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

![The audio block toolbar.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/156562575-6535b885-250e-4148-9369-2d923b448b40.png)The *audio block* has an alignment toolbar icon.### Adding Files

When you add an *audio block*, you get three options: *Upload, Media Library,* and *Insert from URL.*

![TheÂ audio blockÂ allows you to Upload Media, use media in your Library, or add from a custom URL.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/156562576-77cb4e11-89ec-4fab-ad09-1659d0ddaca3.png)The *audio block* allows you to Upload Media, use media in your Library, or add from a custom URL.Upload will allow you to upload a new audio file from your computer. Media Library lets you select a file thatâs already uploaded to your siteâs Media Library. Insert from URL lets you input a URL where the file has already been uploaded, on WordPress.com or elsewhere on the web.

Once youâve selected your audio file you can start configuring your *audio block*!

### Alignment

When you select your *audio block*, a toolbar will appear where you can change blockâs alignment. Choosing right or left will allow you to place another block alongside the *audio block*.

![Alignment settings for the audio block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-block-alignment-WP-62-1024x506.png)

- **None** â Default alignment option.
- **Wide width** â Increase the width of the post beyond the content size.
- **Full width** â Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.
- **Align left** â Make the block left-aligned.
- **Align center** â Make the block alignment centered.
- **Align right** â Make the block right aligned.

### Replace Audio

This is another option in the *audio blockâs* toolbar. Choosing this will allow you to select a new audio file for your block. Use this if you need to replace the audio file in your *audio block*.

![When you select the Replace option in the block toolbar you can choose between opening the media library or uploading a file.
There is also information about the URL to the current media file.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-block-replace-WP-62-1024x428.png)### Caption

If your audio file has a caption in the Media Library, it is shown below the audio player:

![The caption is below the audio player.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/Audio-block-caption-1-WP-62-1024x265.png)If your file does not have a caption in the Media library, you can add a custom caption by selecting the Add caption option in the toolbar:

![The Add caption option is in the block toolbar next to the alignment options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-block-add-caption-WP-62-1024x208.png)Both the Media Library caption and the placeholder text are editable. Select the caption to edit the text. You can use the caption toolbar to make the text bold or italic, or add a link. Select the arrow icon in the toolbar to access more options:

![The caption has a toolbar with options for making selected text bold or italic, an option to add a link, and a "more options" menu.
More options include highlighting text, inline code, inline image, and more.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-block-caption-toolbar-WP-62-1024x661.png)You can remove a caption by selecting the Remove caption button in the toolbar:

![The Remove caption option is in the block toolbar next to the alignment options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-block-remove-caption-WP-62-1024x281.png)### More Options 

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](#documentation/article/more-options)

## Block Settings

Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. *If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the âsettingsâ icon next to the Publish button.*

![The settings sidebar can be opened using the Settings the button next to the Publish button.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/WP-62-block-editor-settings-icon.png)The block settings can be found in the sidebar.### Settings tab

![The audio settings for the audio block are in the block settings sidebar.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-settings-tab-WP-62.png)#### Autoplay &amp; Loop

These options let you set your audio file to autoplay when someone visits the page or post. Looping lets you choose if the audio file repeats after itâs finished.

#### Preload

This option allows you to select how much of the audio file is downloaded when the page or post is loaded. While it may be tempting to go ahead and have the whole file download automatically, keep in mind that this can slow your pageâs load speed down.

There are four settings:

**Browser default** â Use settings from site visitorâs browser.

**Auto** â The entire audio file is downloaded, regardless of whether the visitor clicks the Play button or not. This makes the biggest impact on your page or postâs load speed, especially with larger audio files.

**Metadata** â Only basic info about the file will be downloaded automatically. Like the None option, the download of the audio file only begins when someone clicks Play. This setting is also very fast, as the only thing downloaded is text. On a fundamental level, thereâs not a big difference between None and Metadata.

**None** â Nothing about the audio file is downloaded automatically. The download of the audio file only begins when your visitor clicks the Play button. This is the fastest setting.

#### Advanced

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

![The advanced tab for the audio block.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/157893362-4a01d92a-df33-44fd-a68b-4bcf505c497b.png)The advanced section lets you add an HTML anchor and a CSS class to your block.### Styles tab

![The style settings for the audio block are in the Styles tab in the block settings sidebar.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-styles-tab-WP-62.png)**Dimensions**

The **Audio block** provides dimension settings options to add padding and margin.

For details refer to this support article: [Dimension settings overview](#documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview)

### Troubleshooting

If you try to upload a file type that is not supported, the editor will display a notice with an error message:

![The error message includes the file name followed by the text "Sorry this file type is not supported here."](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/audio-block-unsupported-format-WP-62.png)## Changelog

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/video-block/

[\[Go to the List of Blocks\]](#support/article/blocks)

![video of adding video block ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/video-block.gif)To add the *Video* block to a page, click the (+) icon to open the block inserter pop-up window and choose the *Video* block.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut /video to quickly insert a *Video* block.

Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](#support/article/adding-a-new-block).

When you add a *Video* block, you will be prompted with three options to add your content, Upload, Media Library, and Insert from URL.

The Upload will allow you to upload a new video file from your computer. Media Library lets you select a file thatâs already uploaded to your siteâs media library.

If you insert a URL from a supported block type, such as YouTube, the *Video* block will automatically transform into a *YouTube* block.

![add video and upload video](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/video-block-1024x330.png)Once the video is embedded in the page, you can add an optional caption.

## Block toolbar

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The *Video* block toolbar comes with six buttons:

![block toolbar option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/block-toolbar.png)- Transform to
- Drag icon
- Move arrows
- Align
- Text tracks
- Replace

Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found [here](#support/article/moving-blocks).

**Change alignment**

![align option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/align.png)Use the change alignment tool to align the *Video* block. Choose one of the following options:

- **None** â leaves the block the current size.

- **Align right** â makes the block right-aligned.

The âWide widthâ and âFull widthâ alignment settings must be enabled by your WordPress theme.

**Text tracks**

![text tracks option on block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/text-tracks.png)The *Text* tracks option will allow you to display timed text tracks (such as subtitles or captions) when the media is playing.

The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) â Web Video Text Tracks.

Once you upload the track, you will find the edit track option.

![edit track options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/edit-track-1024x668.png)**Label.** A user-readable title of the text track which is used by the browser when listing available text tracks.

**Source language.** Language of the track text data. It must be a valid BCP 47 language tag. If the Kind attribute is set to Subtitles, then the Source language must be defined.

**Kind.** How the text track is meant to be used. If omitted, the default kind is Subtitles. If the attribute contains an invalid value, it will use Metadata.

- **Subtitles**: Translations of the dialogue in the video for when audio is available but not understood. Subtitles are shown over the video.
- **Captions:** Transcription of the dialogue, sound effects, musical cues, and other audio information for when the viewer is deaf/hard of hearing or the video is muted. Captions are also shown in the video.
- **Descriptions:** Text descriptions of whatâs happening in the video for when the video portion isnât available because the viewer is using assistive technology. Descriptions are read by a screen reader or turned into a separate audio track.
- **Chapters**: Chapter titles that are used to create navigation within the video. Typically theyâre in the form of a list of chapters that the viewer can click on to go to a specific chapter.
- **Metadata**: Tracks with data meant for javascript to parse and do something with. These arenât shown to the user.

**Replace**

![replace button on toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/replace.png)The *Replace* option will allow you to select a new video file for your block. Use this if you need to replace the video file in your *Video* block. Youâll have the option to select Open Media Library, Upload, or Current media URL.

**Options**

The *Options* button on a block toolbar gives you more features to customize the block.

[Read about these and other settings.](#support/article/more-options)

## Block settings

The **block** settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the cog icon next to the **Publish** button.

![block settings option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/block-settings.png)**Settings**

![settings for block editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/settings.png)- **Autoplay, Loop, Muted**. These options let you set your video file to autoplay when someone visits the page or post. Looping lets you choose if the video file repeats after it is finished. You can also choose to mute the video if your circumstance requires it.
- **Play inline**. This option lets you set your video to be played *inline*, that is within the elementâs playback area. Keep in mind that turning this option off does not imply that the video will always be played in fullscreen.

**Playback controls**

Toggle this option to show or hide the playback control overlay on the video. For example, a video with playback controls:

![playback control option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/playback-controls-1024x570.png)Without playback controls:

![no play back for video option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/no-playback-1024x571.png)**Preload**

![preload option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/preload.png)This option allows you to select how much of the video file is downloaded when the page or post is loaded. While it may be tempting to go ahead and have the whole file download automatically, keep in mind that this can slow your pageâs load speed down.

There are three settings:

- **Auto** â The entire video file is downloaded, regardless of whether the visitor clicks the Play button or not. This makes the biggest impact on your page or postâs load speed, especially with larger video files.
- **Metadata** â Only basic info about the file will be downloaded automatically. Like the None option, the download of the video file only begins when someone clicks Play. This setting is also very fast, as the only thing downloaded is text. On a fundamental level, thereâs not a big difference between None and Metadata.
- **None** â Nothing about the video file is downloaded automatically. The download of the video file only begins when your visitor clicks the Play button. This is the fastest setting.

**Poster image**

![poster image and select button](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/poster-image.png)You can choose a poster image that will be displayed before a video is set to play. This can be useful if the first frame of the video isnât necessarily appealing or indicative of the video content. An eye-catching poster image can really draw attention to your video.

**Dimensions**

The *Video* block provides dimension settings options to change padding and margin size.

For details, refer to this support article: [Dimensions Settings Overview](#documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview)

# Preformatted block <a name="documentation/article/preformatted-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preformatted-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

If you wish to add text to a post or page that is displayed exactly as you type it, the **Preformatted Block** is for you. You can create one by clicking the **Block Inserter** icon.

You can also type *â/preformattedâ* and hit the enter key in an empty paragraph block to quickly create one.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/10/Screenshot.png)[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

The **Preformatted Block** shares a lot of similarities with the **Paragraph Block** and the **Code Block***.* Think of it as a hybrid of the two.

Like **Paragraph Block**, the **Preformatted Block** is intended primarily to display text. Unlike the **Paragraph Block**, though, the **Preformatted Block** keeps any spacing or line breaks exactly as they are entered.

Similar to the **Code Block**, the **Preformatted Block** is displayed in a monospace font, making it easy to keep text perfectly aligned. However, the **Preformatted Block** also includes styling and the ability to add hyperlinks (described below) that a **Code Block** doesnât have.

## Block Toolbar

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and block specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The **Preformatted Block** shows the standard eight buttons:

- Change block type or style
- Drag
- Moving handles
- Bold
- Italic
- Hyperlink
- More rich text controls
- More options

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/Preformatted-block-change-block-type-5.9.png)You can transform the **Preformatted Block** into **Paragraph Block**, **Columns Block**, **Code Block,** or **Group**. The **Group** would give you the ability to change the background color around the **Preformatted Block**.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/overview-pullquote-block-v5.9-1.png)Pullquotes are like blockquotes but designed to draw attention.  
To add one, click the **Block Inserter** icon when editing your post or page.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/add-pullquote-block-v5.9.png)*Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).*

  
  
In this video, you can see how you can use the pullquote block and the different settings to modify how your pullquote will appear.

How pullquote block works##   
Block Toolbar

In order to reveal the block toolbar, you can click on the block and the toolbar will display.

- More options

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/toolbar-pullquote-block-v5.9.png)The *pullquote block* has alignment and text formatting options.### Transform to

You can transform the pullquote block into a âParagraphâ block, âGroupâ block, âQuoteâ block, âListâ block, or âHeadingâ block. The âGroupâ would give you the ability to change the background color around the Quote.

You can also transform the style of your pullquote block

The *pullquote block* includes two styles, âDefaultâ and âSolidâ color.

The âDefaultâ pullquote is a simple style that looks like this:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/overview-pullquote-block-v5.9-1.png)Pullquote default color styleThe âsolid colorâ pullquote is a little different, and looks like this:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/solid-color-style.png)Pullquote solid color styleWhile it looks like a variation on the âDefault colorâ pullquote, the âsolid colorâ pullquote really shines when you use the blockâs color settings to select colors.

# Columns block <a name="documentation/article/columns-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/columns-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Columns Block* allows you to insert text, media, and other types of content into columns â limit 6. When used one after another, the columns can create a grid effect.

You can type */*columns and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly.

![Image showing how to add a columns block with the slash inserter.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-09-at-11.11.49-AM.png)[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

Once you add the *Columns Block*, you can choose a variation to start with (and you can change the number or add more columns later). If you want to use the default variation (50 / 50), you can click on the *Skip* option at the bottom.

![Columns block placeholder](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image14.png)## Adding and removing columns

It is possible to add or remove columns. To do so, click outside the box, between the box and the sidebar, then change the number of columns (up to six is recommended). Alternatively, you can adjust the number of columns in the block setting section.

![The demonstration of adding columns block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/columns.gif)## Adding content to the columns

Once you have defined the number of columns, you can add content to each column. The amazing thing about the columns block is that you can add other blocks into each of the columns.

For instance, you can use the *Columns Block* as the structure and add an image, heading, and paragraph block to create a grid of services.

![Using the columns block with images](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image4-1.png)Or you can use the *Columns Block* with the *Cover Block* to feature pages of your site.

![Using the columns block with cover block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image7-1.png)You could also use the *Columns Block* with the *Button Block* to invite users to take some actions on your site.

![Using the columns block for buttons layout](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image8.png)## Block toolbar

Most blocks have their own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The *Columns Block* shows the following buttons:

- Transform to
- Moving handles
- Change alignment
- Change vertical alignment
- More options

![Columns block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image17.png)### Transform to

![The block settings button](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image5.png)Note that since the *Columns Block* has the ability to embed other blocks if you click specifically on one of the columns, the settings in the sidebar will change according to the block you added to the selected column (e.g. if you added an image to one of the columns when you click on the image the sidebar will display the options from the *Image Block* settings).

Here are the options for the *Columns block:

### Columns

In the *Columns* settings, you can set the number of columns (**1** to **6**). You can edit the number of columns by clicking on the up and down arrows, dragging the slider to the right or left, or by typing the number directly in the field.

![Styles tab](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/05/image10.png)### Color

With *Color settings*, you can change the color of the text in your block, the color of links, and the background color of your block. For the columns block, this means that you can style each column individually or both columns for consistency.

# (Deprecated)Button Block <a name="documentation/article/button-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/button-block/

[Go to the List of Blocks](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *button block* has been deprecated since WordPress 5.4. Please use the [*buttons block* ](#documentation/article/buttons-block)instead.

# More block <a name="documentation/article/more-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/more-block/

[Go to the List of Blocks](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *More block* is used to display a âRead Moreâ link to the full blog post, on the blog home page, or on the archive pages.

If your theme is set to show the postâs full content on archive pages or the blog home page, then a post using the *More block* truncates your blog entries so that only the part of the post before the *More block* is displayed on the home page and archive pages, followed by a âRead Moreâ link. Clicking on the âRead Moreâ link directs the reader to the full blog post.

If your theme is set to show only the excerpts on the archives page and the blog home page, the *More block* is ignored. The excerpt displayed is the one [manually entered for the post](#documentation/article/excerpt).

The More block can be placed anywhere in a post. You can customize the link to say whatever you want. You can only insert one More block in each Post.

The More Block works only for Posts, (not Pages).

And this is how it will look on your site (Styles may vary depending on your theme).

[![How More Block works on the front end](#documentation/files/2019/03/more-block-result.png)](#documentation/files/2019/03/more-block-result.png)More block (result)To add a More block, click on the **Block Inserter** icon.

**Editing the Block**

Once you add the block, you can edit the Read More text that appears by default by clicking in the middle of the dashed lines, erasing the text, and typing anything you want. To revert back to the default text that your theme displays, remove all the text from the More block and save your Post.

[![Editing the More Block text](#documentation/files/2019/03/more-block-edit-text.gif)](#documentation/files/2019/03/more-block-edit-text.gif)## Block Toolbar

# Spacer block <a name="documentation/article/spacer-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/spacer-block/

If you want to have a space between two blocks, the spacer block is what you will use.  
A **vertical** spacer adds space between blocks in a column (as in a page or post).  
A **horizontal** spacer adds space between blocks in a row (as in a [Navigation block](#support/article/navigation-block)).

(Note: Using a Navigation block requires a [block theme](#themes/tags/full-site-editing) or a theme that has support for [template editing](#themes/tags/template-editing).)

In this video, you can see how you can use the spacer block and the different settings to modify it.

Demo of inserting Spacer block into post content and modifying its settings.To add an *spacer block*, click on the **Add Block** icon.

You can also type /spacer and hit enter in a new *paragraph block* to add one quickly.

- **Separator**: Changes the Spacer into a visual horizontal line that helps divide content, providing a cleaner visual break between sections.
- **Group**: Allows you to wrap the Spacer inside a Group, enabling background color, padding, margin, and border customization for better layout styling.
- **Columns**: Useful if you want to place multiple blocks side-by-side; this transformation helps shift the layout into a multi-column structure.
- **Details**: Converts the Spacer into a collapsible content block, allowing additional context or content to be toggled by the user.

**Drag icon:**

![Media & Text block settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/media-text-settings-WP-62.png)**Stack on Mobile**

You will be given the option to stack the media and text on top of each other for mobile phones. This is useful for people viewing your website on smaller screens.

If the media and text in your block were to stay side-by-side on mobile, they may be too small to view on mobile devices. By enabling *stack on mobile,* the content on the left will show on top of the content on the right. This provides a better experience for mobile visitors.

**Crop image to fill entire column**

If your image does not fit the entire column width, you can turn on this option to automatically crop the image so that it fills the entire column. Additionally, you are given a circular focal point to help center the most relevant section of your photo as it is possible that some cropping may occur.

**Alt text ( alternative text)**

You can add alt text to the image to describe what the image is about. It is useful for accessibility (screen readers, for example) and for search engine optimization.

**Image size**

You can choose a full, large, medium, or thumbnail image to display by selecting the size desired from the drop-down menu.

**Media width**

You can adjust the proportion that the media takes up in the overall percentage of the *Media &amp; Text* *block* by adjusting the sliders or typing in the desired proportion. The range is between 15% and 85 %.

![Media & Text focal point picker for cropped images](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/media-text-foca-point-WP-62.png)**Focal point picker**

### Styles tab

#### Color

The **media &amp; text block** provides color settings options to change the text, background, and link colors. Pick a color from the suggestions, or add a custom color using the color picker or by adding a color code.

# Settings Privacy screen <a name="documentation/article/settings-privacy-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-privacy-screen/

WordPress 4.9.6 included a Privacy Settings tool. Administrator can create new page or specify existing one as Privacy Policy page of the site.

Note: The new page will include help and suggestions for your privacy policy. However, it is your responsibility to use those resources correctly, to provide the information that your privacy policy requires, and to keep that information current and accurate.

### Using Privacy Settings tool

1\. Select **Settings** -&gt; **Privacy** from Administration Screens.

[![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/PrivacySettingsTool_4.9.6.jpg?fit=1083%2C673&ssl=1)](#support)2\. Click **Create New Page** to generate a Privacy Policy Page. Or, Select an existing page which you want to use from drop down box and click **Use This Page**.

3\. If you click **Create New Page**, then template page titled Privacy Policy will be opened. Modify the contents and click Publish.

Hint: If you need help, click the link of âCheck out our guideâ for recommendations on what content to include.

[![](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/PrivacySettingsTool_Editor_4.9.6.jpg?fit=1089%2C683&ssl=1)](#support)## Where is the Privacy Policy page displayed?

The Privacy Policy page will be shown on your login and registration pages. Notice the bottom Link âPrivacy Policyâ.

[![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/PrivacySettingsTool_4.9.6_login.jpg?fit=435%2C568&ssl=1)](#support)It is your responsibility to create a link to the Privacy Policy page to every page on your site. But theme will support such function soon. For example, Twenty Seventeen adds the link to the Privacy Policy page at the bottom.

## To Theme Developers

For users convenience, you should refer these new functions.

- `get_privacy_policy_url()` â Retrieves the URL to the privacy policy page.
- `the_privacy_policy_link()` â Displays the privacy policy link with formatting, when applicable.
- `get_the_privacy_policy_link()` â Returns the privacy policy link with formatting, when applicable.

This is the example from Twenty Seventeen (twentyseventeen/template-parts/footer/site-info.php)

```
if ( function_exists( 'the_privacy_policy_link' ) ) {
    the_privacy_policy_link( '', '<span role="separator" aria-hidden="true"></span>' );
}
```

# Appearance Themes Screen <a name="documentation/article/appearance-themes-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/appearance-themes-screen/

The **Appearance Themes Screen** allows you to manage your Themes. That means you can install, preview, delete Themes, activate, and update Themes.

A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a weblog. These files are called **template files**. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (\*.jpg, \*.gif), style sheets (\*.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (\*.php).

### Manage Themes

#### Current Theme

The current active Theme appears first in the upper left corner. Initially, as part of the WordPress installation process, the [WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme](/themes/twentynineteen/) is displayed as the active Theme.

[![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/themes-screen.png?fit=1296%2C308&ssl=1)](#support)Themes Screen![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/theme-twenty-ninteen.png)

A small screenshot of the Theme is shown. If you roll over the image with your cursor, a âTheme Detailsâ button appears. Click it and youâll be provided with the name of the Theme, the Theme version, the Theme author, and a short description of the Theme. Additional buttons are below that activate specific current theme appearance screens that correspond to the menu picks on the left.

**Update Available**

If there is an update available for the Theme a message similar to this is displayed: â**There is a new version of Coral Lite available.**View Details or update now.â

- **View Details** : click this link and a page from the WordPress Theme Directory will display the details of that specific version.
- **Update now** : click this link to install the Theme upgrade. Also donât forget that Themes can be upgraded via the Administration &gt; Dashboard &gt; Updates Screen.

[![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/themes-more-info.png?fit=591%2C298&ssl=1)](#support)Theme Needing updates#### Available Themes

The remainder of the Manage Themes screen shows the other Themes that are installed. If there are more than 15 installed Themes then a page navigation tool is displayed above and below the available Themes. Fifteen Themes per page are displayed, so click the page number to navigate to the next or previous page of Themes.

As with the Current Theme image, a small screenshot of each Theme is shown. Roll over the image to show âTheme Detailsâ, âActivateâ, and âLive Previewâ buttons. Click the âTheme Detailsâ button to see, along with the name of the Theme, the Theme version, and the Theme author, a short description of the Theme. The Theme Details modal has buttons displayed to Activate, Live Preview, and links to Delete, and if available, upgrade the Theme.

**Activate**

Click this to make this Theme the Current Theme.

**Live Preview**

Click this link and you can preview how your blog will appear with this specific theme version.

**Delete**

Click this to delete the Theme completely. The Theme files and folders will be completely deleted, so if you have made any customizations to that Theme, they too will be deleted so please consider backing up before deleting.

**Update Available**

Refer Current Theme section.

### Install Themes

Themes can be installed in several ways:

- The automated Theme installer for Themes located in the WordPress Theme Directory
- The upload method for any Theme that is located in a ZIP file on your local computer
- The manual method via an FTP connection from your local machine to your host
- The manual method via a hosting control panel such as cPanel

Each of these installation methods is described below.

#### Automated Theme installer

The automated Theme installer can be used to install any Theme in the [WordPress Theme Directory](#extend/themes). This is the easiest way to install a Theme.

Visit Administration &gt; Appearance &gt; **Themes**, click the Add New button. You can find additional themes for your site from the [WordPress Theme Directory](/themes/). These themes are designed and developed by third parties, are available free of charge, and are compatible with the license WordPress uses.

Use one of three Search methods to find the desired Theme:

- **Filter search** â at the top of the screen select one of three filters, Featured, Popular, or Latest. When you find a theme you like, you can preview it or install it.
- **Keyword search** â Enter keyword, author, or tag. The search results will be updated as you type.
- **Attribute search** â Click Feature Filter link to get more specific and search by categorized criteria. Select multiple criteria and click Apply Filters button.

[![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/theme-features.png?fit=739%2C485&ssl=1)](#support)Themes Features Search Once you have generated a list of themes, you can preview and install any of them. Click on the thumbnail of the theme youâre interested in previewing. It will open up in a full-screen Preview page to give you a better idea of how that theme will look.

To install the theme so you can preview it with your siteâs content and customize its theme options, click the âInstallâ button at the top of the left-hand pane. The theme files will be downloaded to your website automatically. When this is complete, the theme is now available for activation, which you can do by clicking the âActivateâ link. Or you may click âLive Previewâ or âReturn to Theme Installerâ.

[![](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/theme-add-upload-process.png?fit=410%2C147&ssl=1)](#support)Installing a theme (Upload Method)#### Using the upload method

The upload method is another easy way to install a Theme. This can be used to install any Theme that is in a ZIP file. All the Themes in the [WordPress Theme Directory](#extend/themes) can be installed using this method. Download the ZIP file. First find the Theme you want to install. Other sources of Themes can be used and the key is to download the Theme ZIP file to your local computer. Place the file anywhere convenient.

Visit Administration &gt; Appearance &gt; **Themes**, click the Add New button, then click the Upload Theme link. Click **Browse** button and specify the ZIP file you downloaded in above step and click Install Now.

The Install Theme from uploaded file will display the results of the installation. Click the **Activate** link to make that the Current Theme.

#### Using the FTP method

1. Download the Theme files to your local computer. If the Theme is in ZIP file archive and extract the ZIP file contents to a folder on your local computer. You may need to preserve the directory structure in the archive when extracting these files. Follow the guidelines provided by your Theme author.
2. Using an FTP client to access your host web server. If necessary create a directory to contain your Theme in the /wp-content/themes directory provided by WordPress. For example, a Theme named **Test** should be in /wp-content/themes/test. Your Theme may provide this directory as part of the archive.
3. Upload the Theme files to the new directory on your host server.
4. Visit Administration &gt; Appearance &gt; **Themes**, if necessary navigate to the page displaying that Theme, then click the Activate link to make the Theme, the Current Theme.

#### Installing with cPanel

If your host offers the cPanel control panel, and the Theme files are in a .zip or .gz archive follow these instructions.

1. Download the Theme ZIP file to your local machine.
2. In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your Themes folder. If you have WordPress installed in itâs own folder called wordpress, you would navigate to âpublic\_html/wordpress/wp-content/themesâ and if WordPress is installed in your web-root folder you would navigate to âpublic\_html/wp-content/themesâ.
3. Once youâve navigated to the Themes folder in cPanel File Manager, click on Upload file(s) and upload that ZIP file you saved in Step 1.
4. Once the ZIP file is uploaded, click on the ZIP file name in cPanel, then in the panel to the right, click on Extract File Contents, and that ZIP file will be uncompressed.
5. Visit Administration &gt; Appearance &gt; **Themes**, if necessary navigate to the page displaying that Theme, then click the Activate link to make the Theme, the Current Theme.

# Edit Media <a name="documentation/article/edit-media" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/edit-media/

## Overview

The **Edit Media** page is where you manage information about your media that is saved in the [Media Library](#documentation/article/media-library-screen). To reach the **Edit Media** page, go to **Media &gt; Library** and click the name of the media item or the **Edit** link that appears below the name on hover. You can also reach this page by clicking on the **Edit** link when [adding new media](#documentation/article/media-add-new-screen) to your site.

The data entered on the **Edit Media** page is often used by attachment pages and galleries if the theme or plugin chooses to display it, and the data is also used as the default values at the time an image is inserted into a page. Once the image has been inserted as an individual image, it becomes disconnected from the data in the media library and you can use the Image Details screen to update it on a per-image basis.

In addition to managing meta data such as title, caption, alt text, and description, there are also added controls for performing basic media edits such as rotating, scaling, and cropping images. For more information see the [Edit Image](#documentation/article/edit-media) section.

![Edit media page showing the options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/edit-media-1024x973.png)Edit media showing the options## [Edit media page](#documentation/article/edit-media)

**Title**

The name of the media. A title is displayed in the File column of the [Media Library Screen](#documentation/article/media-library-screen) and is often shown on attachment pages and galleries if themes or plugins are designed to display it.

**Permalink**

This is the URL of the media attachment page. There is also a link to view the attachment page. Next to this, there may be a button to edit the permalinkâif there isnât, you can change the permalink by activating âSlugâ from the screen options and changing the slugâs value.

**Edit image button**

(Image files only) allows you to make edits such as rotate, scale, and crop.

![Edit image options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/edit-image-1024x601.png)Edit imageClicking the **Edit Image** button launches the image editor screen, giving you access to several useful image editing controls. The edits you make to your image are *non-destructive* and you can restore the image to its original (uploaded) specifications at any time. Here are the various controls available to you in this **Edit Image** mode:

**Crop**

To crop the image, first, click on the image and drag to make your selection. Once a selection has been made, then click the crop icon above the image to finalize the crop. You can use the **Aspect ratio** and **Selection** option to make further adjustments or use [keyboard shortcuts](#documentation/article/edit-media) to fine-tune your crop selection before clicking the crop icon.

**Rotate left button**

Rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

**Rotate right button**

Rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise.

**Flip vertical button**

Flip the image upside-down.

**Flip horizontal button**

Flip the image left-to-right.

**Undo/Redo button**

Remove or restore your last edit. You can click as many times as you want in succession to âstepâ through the edit history.

**Scale image**

Proportionally scale the original image. For best results, scaling should be done before you crop, flip, or rotate. Images can only be scaled down, not up. The original dimensions are displayed as a guideline above the box for entering new dimensions. Click **Scale** button to display the new scaled image. Also **Restore Original Image** button appears to allow you restore the change.

**Restore original image**

If changes have been made to an image, the Restore Original Image pull-down allows you to discard any changes and restore the original image. Previously edited copies of the image will not be deleted. Press the Restore Image button to complete the action.

![restore original image size after scaling the image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/restore-image.gif)Restore original image**Image crop**

Used in combination with the *Crop* icon, this tool allows you to make the following precise adjustments:

- **Crop aspect Ratio:** You can specify the crop selection aspect ratio then hold down the Shift key while dragging to lock it. The values can be 1:1 (square), 4:3, 16:9, etc. If there is a selection, specifying aspect ratio will set it immediately.
- **Crop selection**: Once started, the selection can be adjusted by entering new values (in pixels). Note that these values are scaled to approximately match the original image dimensions. The minimum selection size equals the thumbnail size as set in the [Settings Media Screen](#documentation/article/settings-media-screen).

**Thumbnail settings**

WordPress thumbnails are smaller, usually square, versions of your main image. They are automatically created each time you upload a new image. By default, a WordPress thumbnail image is 150px x 150px, and cropped as a perfect square. (You can adjust this on the [Settings Media Screen](#documentation/article/settings-media-screen).)

When editing an image, you have three options. You can apply your changes to

- All image sizes
- Thumbnail
- All sizes except thumbnail

![Options for thumbnail settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/edit-image-thumbnail.png)Thumbnail Settings**Save**

Use this to save the changes made to an image and return to the **Edit Media** screen for this image.

**Cancel**

Use this to cancel any operation that has been performed on the image in the current session.

### [Keyboard shortcuts](#documentation/article/edit-media)

When cropping your image, these keyboard combinations can âfine-tuneâ the size of the crop frame. Note: The arrow key can be any of four arrow keysâup arrow, down arrow, left arrow, or right arrow:

- **Arrow:** move by 10px
- **Shift + arrow:** move by 1px
- **Ctrl + arrow:** resize by 10px
- **Ctrl + Shift + arrow:** resize by 1px
- **Shift + drag:** lock aspect ratio

# FAQ I make changes and nothing happens <a name="documentation/article/faq-i-make-changes-and-nothing-happens" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-i-make-changes-and-nothing-happens/

**Important:** Please note that this is not a support page. If you seek help with your specific problem, please refer to the [Support forums](#support/welcome).

After you make a few changes in your WordPress content or your design, you may notice that nothing has changed.

A number of common factors can cause this behavior, such as: browser caching, server-side caching, caching plugins, and making changes in the incorrect location in the file system.

## The Browser Cache

Sometimes when you first visit a web page, it takes a while to load. But then the next page you visit within that site doesnât take quite so long. This is because â in an effort to be helpful â your web browser stores the web page information on your computer. In the future, the web browser reloads the web page data from your computer, not from the actual site. The place where this web page data is stored is called the **cache**. The cache is an essential way to optimize your web browsing experience.

Sometimes a problem can arise when you make a small change to your site, and the browser doesnât recognize it as a significant change. Since the browser hasnât registered your adjustment as an actual change, it opts to reload the exact same page that you previously looked at. The solution in this case is to clear or empty your **browserâs cache**.

### Clearing the Browser Cache

Normally, to see the changes on your page, you click the **Refresh** button on the browser toolbar or press the F5 key on your keyboard. In many cases, this simply reloads the page without clearing the browserâs cache. Here are some techniques to wipe clean the browserâs cache, so that you will see the changes when your page reloads.

The way you clear the browser cache depends on the particular browser you are using. Here is how you clear the cache on a few common browsers:

- **Chrome** â [How to delete your Chrome cache, history, and other browser data](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95582?hl=en)
- **Safari** â [Clear your browsing history in Safari on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/clear-your-browsing-history-sfri47acf5d6/12.0/mac/10.14)
- **Firefox** â [How to clear the F](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache)i[refox cache](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-clear-firefox-cache)
- **Internet Explorer** â [How to delete the contents of the Temporary Internet Files folder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/260897/how-to-delete-the-contents-of-the-temporary-internet-files-folder)
- **Microsoft Edge** â [View and delete browser history in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/view-and-delete-browser-history-in-microsoft-edge-00cf7943-a9e1-975a-a33d-ac10ce454ca4)
- **Opera** â [How to clear the Opera cache](http://help.opera.com/Windows/12.10/en/cache.html)

In addition to clearing the cache, each browser may have a way of stopping or minimizing the caching of web pages. Using this technique will definitely slow down your web page viewing, and it isnât a perfect solution, because some caching may still occur. However, in a small way it does still help. Check your internet browserâs help files for specifics on how to turn off the cache feature.

## Server-side Caching

Be aware that some web hosting services use caching plugins on the backend without letting the user know explicitly. You may be able to turn this off via your webhostâs configuration panel. Just to be sure, you can ask a webhost support member if any caching plugins are used, and request to have them turned off if needed.

This situation may also occur if you are using a managed WordPress hosting plan. Many managed WordPress hosting plans use server-side caching. If you are using a managed WordPress service from your hosting provider and you are seeing this issue, you may want to see if they have an option to manually flush the cache. In many cases, your changes will immediately show up after flushing the cache.

If you are using a caching HTTP reverse proxy such as Varnish on your web server, edits to your files may not appear right away. Edits may become visible after some length of time when the cached version expires. You many need to tune your caching system in order to eliminate this issue.

## A WordPress Cache Plugin

Some WordPress plugins also add cache functionality to your WordPress site. This helps your site load faster, because WordPress can retrieve the pages of your blog from the cache instead of generating them all over again.

Any good cache plugin will clear the cache when a post, page, or comment is published. However, if you make other changes (e.g. to your theme), the cache may not be cleared and the old version will still appear. In this case, check the pluginâs instructions to find out how to clear its cache.

Note that WordPress does *not* come with a cache by default, so the above would only apply if you installed a cache plugin yourself.

## Check Your Source

Sometimes even the very best web page designers, developers, and programmers make a mistake. Itâs the little details that can mess things up. Letâs look at some of the most commonly overlooked details that happen when you arenât paying attention.

### Check the Address

Is the name and folder for the file you âfixedâ the same as the one you are viewing? Look at the following two addresses (URLs).

- wordpress/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/style.css
- test/wordpress/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/style.css

In this case, you can probably see the difference, but when viewed in an address bar or in a text editor, you might miss the word test that specifies a specific folder location.

Pay very close attention to the difference between style1.css and stylel.css if you are using different style names, too. The first filename is style followed by the digit one, while the second filename is style followed by a lowercase L. If you are working with different but similar files, make sure you give them distinctive names like style-red.css and style-800.css so you can clearly see the difference.

### Check the Template

If youâre editing a template, are you sure that the page youâre viewing is being generated from that template? Remember that many templates contain very similar text. For example, a post header may appear on a single post page, an index page, a search page, or an archive page, to name a few.

See [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) if youâre having trouble figuring out which template is in use.

### Check Your Upload

When you make a change to a file, it is often on your computerâs hard drive, and you have to upload the file to your host server in order to view it on the internet. Did you actually upload it? Did you put it in the right folder? Is it really there? When overwriting the exact same file, it doesnât always do a complete overwrite, so consider deleting the original from the host server and then uploading a new version, to make sure that the correct file is there in its entirety.

### Test Yourself

Letâs say that:   
a) Youâre working with the correct file, and   
b) Itâs in the right place with the right name, but you still canât see the changes youâve made.

At this point, itâs time to complete the following steps:

1. Make a backup of the file you are working on and check that the backup is in a safe place.
2. Make a big change (such as setting the background in your style.css as #ff0000 or even red).
3. View the changed web page in your browser. Make sure you clear the cache, to be sure you have the new version.
4. If nothing changes, delete the file (and only that file) from the server and try to view the file again. If nothing continues to change, you and WordPress are looking at completely different files. Itâs time to get out your detective hat and start figuring out what is happening and where your files went.
5. Check your URL settings in your options panel and also in the database. If this issue still continues to be unsolvable, make a post about it on the [WordPress Forum](#support/forums), and let the experts step in to help.

# Why should I use HTTPS <a name="documentation/article/why-should-i-use-https" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/why-should-i-use-https/

HTTPS is an encrypted communication protocol â essentially, a more secure way of browsing the web, since you get a private channel directly between your browser and the web server. Thatâs why most major sites use it.

If a siteâs using HTTPS, youâll see a little padlock icon in the address field, just as in the screenshot below:

![Screenshot of the "secure site" padlock icon](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/image.png)Here are the most common reasons you might want to use HTTPS on your own site:

**Faster.** One might think that HTTPS would make your site slower, since it takes some time to encrypt and decrypt all data. But a lot of efficiency improvements to HTTP are only available when you use HTTPS. As a result, HTTPS will actually make your site faster for almost all visitors.

**Trust.** Users find it easier to trust a secure site. While they donât necessarily know their traffic is encrypted, they do know the little padlock icon means a site cares about their privacy. Tech people will know that any servers between your computer and the web server wonât be able to see the information flowing forth and back, and wonât be able to change it.

**Payment security.** If you sell anything on your site, users want to know their payment information is secure. HTTPS, and the little padlock, assure that their information travels safely to the web server.

**Search Engine Optimization.** Many search engines will add a penalty to web sites that donât use HTTPS, thus making it harder to reach the best spots in search results.

**Your good name.** Have you noticed that some websites have the text ânot secureâ next to their address?

That happens when your web browser wants you to know a site is NOT using HTTPS. Browsers want you to think (rightly!) that site owners who canât be bothered using HTTPS (itâs free in many cases) arenât worth your time and certainly not your money.

In turn, you donât want browsers suggesting you might be that kind of shady site owner yourself.

# Page Jumps <a name="documentation/article/page-jumps" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-jumps/

Page jumping, also sometimes referred to as anchor links, is where you click a link and instantly get moved somewhere further up or down a page. This can be particularly useful with a long page.

One way to enable this is by setting an HTML Anchor to a Heading block on your page and creating a link that jumps to the anchor. [You can even jump to another pageâs anchor](#useful-hint).

This can also be accomplished with any other block that allows for an HTML Anchor to be set under âAdvancedâ. You can review which blocks have the HTML anchor field by reviewing the **[Core Blocks Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/core-blocks/)** and looking for blocks with the `anchor` attribute.

## Create an HTML Anchor

![Where to add an HTML anchor for a block (Heading block) under Block settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/190138307-c7915fea-353c-44a1-9056-a07a3af12790.png)1. Use the Plus Icon to add a new block.
2. Select Heading as the block type, or start typing `/heading` as a shortcut (slash command) to the heading block.
3. Enter your heading text. You may leave blank in heading text if you do not want to display any text.
4. On the right side under Block Settings, click on Advanced.
5. Type a word that will become your link into the HTML Anchor field.

### HTML Anchor Syntax

- HTML Anchor must be unique within a document.
- HTML Anchor is case-sensitive.
- HTML Anchor can include following symbols: hyphen(-), underscore(\_), colon(:), period(.). It cannot include space.
- HTML Anchor must start in the alphabet.

## Link to your HTML Anchor

1. Type some text, or add an image or button that will become what you want your visitors to click on to go to another section.
2. Highlight the text, image or button, and select the link option from the blockâs toolbar.
3. Type in the HTML Anchor you created, starting with the pound (#) symbol. For example, if you created an Anchor named important-notice you would link to #important-notice.

![How to add a link that jumps internally on the page to an HTML anchor.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/190138761-276173ca-c970-4834-90fd-d4ee23a90218.png)### Jumping to an anchor on another page

If you want to jump to another pageâs anchor, then specify URL with HTML Anchor. For example, `example.com/anotherpage#important-notice`

## **Changelog** 

- 2023-07-25 
    - Update video URL
- 2022-10-28 
    - Added a little more information about Page Jump Links use cases and other available blocks

# Adding a new block <a name="documentation/article/adding-a-new-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/

[Go to the List of Blocks](#documentation/article/blocks)

There are several ways to add a block to your post or page from the admin screen of the [WordPress block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) when you are editing your post or page.

You can use the Block Inserter **+** icon to add a block. You can also use a shortcut slash command to quickly add blocks or use the More options on any of the blockâs toolbar to add a block. You can also [move blocks](#documentation/article/moving-blocks) or search for a block in your post or page.

## How to add blocks using the Block Inserter

There are three ways to add a block using the **+** icon (also called the **Block Inserter**).

1. Block inserter icon in the top toolbar
2. Block inserter icon to the right of an empty block
3. Block inserter icon in between blocks

![Three ways to add a block using the block inserter icon](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/06/inserting-block-options-1024x515.png)### Using the Block inserter icon in the top toolbar

Click on the Block Inserter **+** icon in the top toolbar in the [WordPress block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).

You can find a list of all the [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) available in the [WordPress block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor). The most frequently used blocks are listed at the top (based on your [Preference](#documentation/article/preferences-overview) settings). Hovering over each block will show you a brief description and preview of the block.

You can scroll down the list to find blocks in categories, like Text, Media, Design, Widgets, Layout, Theme, or Embeds, You also find third-party blocks from installed plugins.

Once you find the block, drag and drop it into the block editor.

#### Adding Block Patterns using the top-toolbar inserter

[Block Patterns](#documentation/article/block-pattern) are a collection of predefined blocks that you can insert into pages and posts and then customize with your own content. Using a Block Pattern is an easy way to create beautiful layouts that combine different blocks to produce professional designs.

You can open the Patterns tab to view collections of patterns within a specific category like **Featured**, **Call to Action**, **Pages**, and so on, or click the **Explore** **all patterns** button at the bottom of that section to open the patterns in a new, larger, window.

Click on any pattern once and it will be added to your page at the location of your cursor.

#### Adding Media using the top-toolbar inserter

The media tab allows you to view and add to the page images you have used, additionally, you can also view free media content from [Openverse](https://openverse.org/). You can also open your media library using the button at the bottom of the tab.

![Opening the media tab to add media content to the site](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-28-at-16.56.21-878x1024.png)#### Adding a synced pattern using the top-toolbar inserter

if you have synced patterns, you will see Synced patterns tab in a form of an icon as shown below.

![Reusable block tab on the inserter toolbar ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/06/resuable-block-1024x472.png)When you click on the tab you should be able to view and add to the page all the synced patterns you have on the site.

WordPress 6.3 renamed Reusable Blocks to Patterns. A synced pattern will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block.

### Using the Block Inserter icon to the right of an empty block

Click on the Block Inserter **+** icon to the right of an empty block. If the **+** icon isnât displayed first click on the placeholder text.

Clicking the Block Inserter **+** icon will open a modal window with a list of the most frequently used [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) you can also search for a block you would like to use. You can click on top of the block to want to use.

You can also press the Enter/Return on your keyboard after selecting a block to create a new empty block, and click the + Block Inserter to the right of the empty block.

Select a block from the list or click on the âBrowse allâ button to get a list of all the [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) available in the [WordPress block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).

![The block inserter modal window](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/06/add-block.png)When you pick the option to browse all, a larger window of the blocks available will opened.

![The top-toolbar inserter on the page editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/06/browse-all-blocks-1024x589.png)### Using the Block inserter icon in between blocks

When you hover over the gap between two blocks, you will notice a horizontal blue line appear with a **Block Inserter** **+** icon. You can click on this icon to open a modal window with a list of the most frequently used [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks).

## How to add blocks using the slash command 

You can quickly add a block to your post or page using the slash command. This shortcut will help with your writing flow with fewer interruptions searching for a block.

Begin by adding a new paragraph block by pressing Enter or Return on your keyboard.

Then hit the forward-slash (â/â) key followed by the block name. For example: `/image` or `/heading`.

![Add a block using the slash command](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-20-at-2.14.23-PM.png)Add a block using the slash command## How to add blocks using the More option on a blockâs toolbar

You can easily add blocks within blocks that allow nesting such as Group block, Row block, or Stack block.

Select the Group block, Row block, or Stack block. You will find the Block Inserter **+** icon to the bottom right of the group of blocks. Click the Block Inserter **+** icon to quickly add a new block to the nested group.

## How to add blocks using the block directory

You can also discover and install third-party blocks from within the WordPress block editor using the [WordPress block directory](#documentation/article/block-directory).

To search the WordPress block directory, use the Block Inserter **+** icon on the top toolbar in the WordPress block editor and search for available blocks.

WordPress first runs a search on the available blocks that come with WordPress. If itâs unable to find any block that meets the criteria, it starts searching the block directory and gives you a list. Click on any from the list to install the third-party block.

The block directory search functionality is only available to WordPress users who have permission to install plugins. If you add a third-party block from the block directory, the corresponding WordPress plugin will be installed on your site.

## How to search for blocks

When you click the Block Inserter **+** icon to insert a new block, you can use the **search box** at the top to search for blocks.

Type in a block name or a keyword for example, `"image"` or `"heading"`. Then a list of blocks that fit the search term will show up in the modal window. You can also see a preview of the block below the list of blocks.

Select the desired block with the mouse click, tap, or arrow keys.

![Search for a block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/06/search-block-from-the-inserter-20220513.png)Search for a blockWhen you use the [slash command](#slash-command) to add a block, you get an auto-suggested list of blocks based on what you start typing.

# RSS block <a name="documentation/article/rss-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/rss-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

An RSS feed is a machine-readable version of the content of a blog or a website.

With the *RSS* block, you can display content from any siteâs RSS feed on your website. You can choose to display the Title, Author, Date, and Excerpt for each item in the feed. You can display the items in a list or as a grid in a set number of columns.

Steps to embed an RSS block

1. First, you need to know the URL of the RSS feed that you want to embed. Some websites display an orange icon ![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/11/RSS-feed-icon.png) with the link of the feed. You can usually find this icon together with social network icons.  
    Our example uses the feed of the [News](#news) section on WordPress.org. [\#newsfeed](#newsfeed)

2. Click the **Block Inserter** (+) icon to add an *RSS* block to your WordPress page/post. Alternatively, you can type /rss and hit enter in a new *paragraph block* to add one quickly.

![Adding RSS block via the WordPress slash command /rss](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-1.png)[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

3. Paste the link of the RSS feed into the text box and click on the **Use URL** button

![Enter URL here user interface for the RSS block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-2-1024x430.png)The *RSS* block now displays the titles of the feed items.

![Display of the RSS feed.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-3-1024x361.png)If you use an URL that canât be embedded, the block shows the message *âRSS Error: WP HTTP Error: A valid URL was not provided.â*.

![Example of a URL that cannot be used in the RSS block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-6-1024x435.png)Use the options in the **Block Toolbar** and the controls in the **Block Settings** panel in your editorâs sidebar to fine-tune the display.

## Block toolbar

Besides the *Mover* and *Drag &amp; Drop* handle, the Block Toolbar for the *RSS* block shows six other buttons:

- Transform To
- Change alignment
- Edit RSS URL
- List view
- Grid view
- More options

![Block toolbar for the RSS block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-4-1.png)**Transform** **to**

You can transform the **RSS block** into **Columns, Details**, or a **Group** block to better suit your layout and design preferences:

- **Group** â Wrap the RSS block in a Group to gain access to additional layout and styling options, such as background color, spacing, and borders.
- **Columns** â Organize the RSS feed into multiple columns for a more structured, grid-like layout.
- **Details** â Use the Details block to wrap the RSS content inside a collapsible section, helping manage long or dense feeds.

![Transform options for the RSS block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/11/rss-transforms.png)**Change alignment**

- **Align left** â Make the block left-aligned.
- **Align center** â Make the block alignment centered.
- **Align right** â Make the block right-aligned.
- **Wide width** â Increase the width of the block beyond the content size.
- **Full width** â Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.

![Change alignment options for RSS block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-7.png)The âWide widthâ and âFull widthâ alignment settings must be enabled by your WordPress theme.

**Edit RSS URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the RSS feed URL in the block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the **Use URL** button.

![Edit RSS Feed URL in the block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-2-1024x430.png)**List** **view**

The **List view** option displays the feed items in an unordered list. Use the Block settings controls to customize the **List view**.

![List view for the RSS block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/RSS-Feed-HelpHub-SS-8-1024x362.png)**Grid view**

# Facebook embed <a name="documentation/article/facebook-embed" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/facebook-embed/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

Due to Facebookâs [decision to close the oEmbed end ](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/08/04/Introducing-graph-v8-marketing-api-v8)point for embedding Facebook links, the block will not work anymore after October 24, 2020. Publishers who want to embed Facebook links into their sites will require a developer account and an appid, and provide an authentication token with their call to the endpoint. Facebook Documentation: [create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/)

WordPress leadership reached out to Facebook but it seems the policy change is final. Apart from alerting users here and in other places, WordPress contributors canât do anything about it.

*Facebook Embed* block allows you to add Facebook posts to your post or pages. Keep in mind that the post needs to be *public* in order to add it.

![Facebook Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image6-1024x467.png)Besides Facebook Posts, you can also share links to Facebook Photos, Facebook Albums, and Facebook Videos.

Note that you can not embed Facebook pages, Facebook events, and Facebook groups.

Embedding a Facebook post is as simple as following these steps:

1. Copy the preferred link from the Facebook post you want to embed. Make sure itâs a public post.

![Copy the preferred link from a Facebook post
](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image3-1024x551.png)2. From the WordPress dashboard, go to your post and click the (+) icon to open the block inserter pop-up window and search for the *Facebook* block. You can also use the keyboard shortcut /facebook to quickly insert a *Facebook* block.

**Block-moving tools**

![Block moving tools in the Facebook embed block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image5.png)Use the block-moving tools to move the block up and down inside the editor.

## Block Settings

The block settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the cog icon next to the Publish button.

![How to show the block settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/image4.png)Besides the Advanced section, the Facebook embed has only one setting in the âBlock Settingsâ sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media settings**

![Media settings turned off in the Facebook embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.46-AM.png)![Media settings turned on in the Facebook embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-20-at-9.29.55-AM.png)Via the *Media Settings* you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is âonâ or blue.

**âOff:â** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position the toggle switch is gray.

# YouTube embed <a name="documentation/article/youtube-embed" />

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

![YouTube icon](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-8.52.08-AM.png)Using the YouTube Embed block you can include a YouTube video into your post/page with play buttons, so your visitor can stay on your site to watch it.

You donât need a YouTube account to embed a video.

Not all videos can be shared this way, though. The publisher needs to âAllow Embeddingâ in the settings of the video and some publishers restrict the countries, where videos can be shared.

![This setting can be found YouTube Studio:
Edit Video > More Options > Check "Allow embedding](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-21-at-8.54.45-AM.png)This setting can be found YouTube Studio:

**Six Steps to embed a YouTube Video in your post or page**

1. Find your video on YouTube.com, and copy the URL of the video from the browser bar

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/YouTube-Embed-URL.jpg)2. **Add a YouTube Embed block to your post.**

3. **Paste the YouTube URL** from Step 1
4. **Click on the âEmbedâ Button**

![YouTube URL paste example into block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-add-url-5-9-1024x411.png)5. **You see the YouTube video in your editor.**

### Playlist

A playlist URL can be embedded and the first video of the list shows in the embed box, with additional navigation for the playlist in the top right corner.

![Playlist example of YouTube Gutenberg Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-playlist-example-5-9-1-1024x812.png)### Live Streams

YouTube Live stream URLs are supported in the form of `youtube.com/live/videocode`

### Unsupported URLs

Not all YouTube links can be used for an embed. When an URL is used that is not suited for embedding, the Block editor offers you two options: to try a different URL or convert the current URL into a Text link.

![Sorry - Content cannot be embedded example from Youtube.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-video-not-found-1024x683.png)## Block Toolbar

Next to the YouTube icon is the âDrag &amp; Drop Handleâ. This can be used to drag your block to another section of your page.

Next to this is the âMoverâ. Up and Down options are presented.

![Block toolbar for the YouTube block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/02/youtube-block-toolbar-5-9.png)YouTube block toolbar**Change Alignment**

# Twitter embed <a name="documentation/article/twitter-embed" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twitter-embed/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

With the Twitter Embed block, you can embed Tweets (posts on Twitter) into your posts and pages. You donât need a Twitter account to be able to use it. You can only embed public tweets, though.

**An example:**

> In the April edition of our "People of WordPress" series, you'll find out how Mario Peshev went from self-taught developer to teaching basic digital literacy. <https://t.co/OFO82H7zHS> [pic.twitter.com/rzqC9F7LEW](https://t.co/rzqC9F7LEW)

> â WordPress (@WordPress) [April 8, 2020](https://twitter.com/WordPress/status/1247690005516034048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Apart from a single tweet you can also use the block to add:

- Profile links â shows the latest tweets from a user.
- Twitter List â shows the latest tweets from a Twitter List.

**Steps to embed a Tweet**

1. **You need to find the URL of the Tweet**  
    Like other social networks, the post date of a single Tweet is linking to the single tweet view. To grab the URL, point your mouse to the date, using the right mouse click menu select Copy Link Address.

![Steps to get the URL for the tweet you want to embed](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-22-at-9.30.14-AM.png)Depending on the version of Twitter Interface (Mobile or Desktop) you can also use the left option ![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/Twitter-CopyLInk-menu-icon.jpg)on the bottom of the tweet

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/calendar-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Calendar Widget block* displays your posts in a calendar format. When you publish a new post, it is automatically added to the Calendar block. If you click on a date, it will open the archive of posts published on that date.

By default, it shows the current month and links to the posts published on various days in that month.

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

Due to Facebookâs [decision to close the oEmbed end ](<http://Facebook announced updates to their Marketing API>)point for embedding Instagram links, the block will not work anymore after October 24, 2020. Publishers who want to embed Facebook links into their sites will require a developer account and an appid, and provide an authenication token with their call to the endpoint. Facebook Documentation: [create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/)

*WordPress leadership reached out to Facebook but it seems the policy change is final. Apart from alerting users here and other place, WordPress contributors canât do anything about it.*

The Facebook embed block was removed for the Gutenberg plugin version 9.0 and will be removed from the upcoming WordPress core version in 5.6

With the Instagram Embed block, you can embed Instagram posts on your posts and pages. You donât need an Instagram account to be able to use it. You can only embed public posts, though.

**An Example:**

![Screenshot of of an instagram post](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/06/first-instagram-embed.png)**Steps to embed an Instagram Post**

1. **Find the URL of the post**

FinNavigate to the Instagram post you want to embed on your page. Copy the link of that post by clicking on it, then on the more options button, and then on the Copy Link. The process is similar for mobile devices.

![The correct URL to copy to use the embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/06/second-instagram-embed.png)2. **Go to your post or page**
3. **Add the Instagram block**
4. **Paste the link into the text box and click the âEmbedâ button**

You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

# Plugin and themes auto-updates <a name="documentation/article/plugins-themes-auto-updates" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/plugins-themes-auto-updates/

To keep your WordPress site secure, you should always update your plugins and themes to the latest version.

When a new version of a plugin or theme is available, an alert bubble is displayed in your WordPress Admin Menu and the corresponding theme or plugin is highlighted on Themes and Plugins Screens.

There are several places where you can manage themes or plugins updates:

- WordPress, Plugins, Themes and Translations updates can be managed on the Updates Screen located in Dashboard &gt; Updates sub menu.
- Themes updates can be managed on the Appearance Screen.
- Plugins updates can be managed on the Plugins Screen.

  
[![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-updates-bubbles-1024x389.png)](#documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-updates-bubbles.png)**Since [WordPress 5.5](#documentation/wordpress-version/version-5-5), websites Administrators can manually opt-in for automatic updates theme by theme and plugin by plugin.**

## Enable auto-updates for themes

On the Appearance Screen, click on a theme thumbnail. In the theme modal, right below the author of the theme, an âEnable auto-updatesâ action link is available. Click on this action link to enable auto-updates for this specific theme.

[![](#documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-update-theme-enable.png)](#documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-update-theme-enable.png)Once enabled, auto-updates can be disabled at any time, using the same toggle link.

Themes auto-updates have to be enabled/disabled theme by theme.

## Enable auto-updates for plugins

Navigate to Plugins Screen. For each plugin, there is an âAutomatic updateâ column with an action link used to enable/disable auto-updates plugin by plugin.

[![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-update-plugins-enable-1-1024x368.png)](#documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-update-plugins-enable-1.png)Click on this action link to enable auto-updates for each specific plugin.

Once enabled, auto-updates can be disabled at any time, using the same toggle link.

### Bulk enable/disable plugins auto-updates

Plugins auto-updates can be bulk enabled or disabled for several plugin at one time by using the bulk action selector. Select plugins using the checkbox located in the first column of the plugins list table and use the bulk action selector located on the top of the table to enable or disable auto-updates. Then click on the âApplyâ button to bulk enable/disable auto-updates for the selected items.

## When do Themes and Plugins auto-updates happen?

By default WordPress runs auto-updates twice per day. If updates are available for plugins or themes with auto-updates enabled, the time until the next scheduled update will be displayed below the enable/disable auto-updates action link.

[![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-updates-plugins-time-1-1024x256.png)](#documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-updates-plugins-time-1.png)The time until next auto-updates is also displayed in the Dashboard &gt; Updates Screen for both Themes and Plugins:

[![](#documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-updates-both-time.png)](#documentation/files/2020/07/helphub-updates-both-time.png)## Email notifications after plugins and themes auto-update attempts

By default WordPress sends email notifications to website owners to inform them that plugins and themes were automatically updated. These email notifications are sent when:

- One or more plugins or themes successfully auto-updated
- One or more plugins or themes failed to auto-update
- Some plugins or themes were successfully auto-updated, and some of them failed

## Advices &amp; Troubleshooting

### Perform regular automatic backups of your website

Before enabling auto-updates on your plugins and themes, you may want to make sure youâre able to rollback to a previous version of your website in case things go wrong.

Various plugins exist to take automatic scheduled backups of your WordPress database and files. This helps to manage your backup collection easily. You can find automatic backup plugins in the **Plugin Browser** on the WordPress Administration Screens or through the [WordPress Plugin Directory](#plugins).

- [List of Backup Plugins](#pluginstags/backup)

### Auto-updates are not available

If auto-updates controls are not available on your Plugins/Themes Admin Screens, please check you are running WordPress version 5.5 or more. Plugins and themes auto-updates were introduced in WP 5.5.

If you are running WordPress 5.5 or more and those controls are still unavailable, it probably means the feature was partially or completely deactivated by your hosting company or by a plugin.

### Auto-updates are not working

Depending on your server, your installation or on the plugins your website is running, auto-updates scheduling may not work correctly. Indeed, they rely on WordPress Cron tasks to actually perform the update.

To check if WordPress Cron tasks are running correctly, go to Tools &gt; Site Health and search for any error message.

**Media**

![Media settings for the embed block with the toggle OFF/ON for resizing on smaller devices.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/image-76.png)Via the **Media Settings**, you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is âonâ or blue.

**Off:** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the **Off** position, the toggle switch is gray.

**On:** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the **On** position.

# Block Directory <a name="documentation/article/block-directory" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-directory/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

The Block Directory is a new way for block editor users to discover, test and install new blocks on their website. It is available to content creators who have the capability to install and activate plugins.

## How to use the Block Directory

1. Select the â+â icon at the top, left-hand corner of the editor to open the Block Inserter.

![The editor with icons displayed at the top, above the page content](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/block-directory-inserter-0-6.7-1024x336.jpg)2. Type a keyword in the search field of the Inserter, like âteamâ or âstaffâ.

WordPress first searches the current site for the block named âteamâ or âstaffâ. If it doesnât find a block, it searches in the Block Directory which is a special corner of the WordPress plugin repository, where single block plugins are available.

If the search finds blocks, they will be displayed in the inserter, including a preview section. Decide which block to use and select it to add it to the page.

![Blocks found in the block directory](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/block-directory-inserter-1-6.7.jpg)In the background the single-block plugin is installed and activated, and the user can continue creating the page.

3. If no blocks are found in either case, a [link to the Block Editor Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/) is displayed with details on how to create your own blocks.

![No results in the Block Directory, which displays a notice about creating your own block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/block-directory-inserter-2-6.7-1024x471.jpg)
4. If the first choice doesnât suit your needs, you can go back to the search and select a different one that also will be installed.

### Examples of tested single-block plugins

- [Block for Apple Maps](#plugins/maps-block-apple),
- [Event block](#plugins/event),
- [User Profile Block](#plugins/user-profile-block)

## How to uninstall the block

Blocks from the Block Directory are installed as a plugin. To uninstall a block that you installed from the Block Directory, go to the Plugins screen. Find the block plugin and deactivate and delete to uninstall the block.

![How to uninstall the block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-09-at-4.42.00-PM-1024x367.png)## How to reinstall a block

If a previously used block is no longer available on the site, you have the option to reinstall it.

When the page is first loaded, a search will be done in the background to check if that block is still available. If it has been found, a **Install \[block name\]** button will be displayed in place of the missing block on the page. Select the button to automatically reinstall the missing block.

![Examples: Missing block with âInstall [block name]" and âKeep as HTMLâ options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/block-directory-reinstall-6.3-1024x241.png)A **Keep as HTML** button will also be displayed, or it will be the only button present if no matching block was found when the page loaded.

You can choose that option instead. It lets you convert the content into a custom HTML block so you still have a chance to use the content of the block you had before.

You could also choose to remove the missing block and choose another one from the Block Directory using the steps outlined above.

# Tag Cloud block <a name="documentation/article/tag-cloud-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tag-cloud-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Tag Cloud block* allows adding tag/category cloud into the page/post. A tag cloud is a list of all [tags](#documentation/article/posts-tags-screen) /categories on your site, displayed in alphabetical order.

Tag cloud helps your readers to discover and search content easily and quickly.

The *Tag Cloud block* displays each tag with the font size based on the number of times that tag has been associated with posts. The bigger the size, the more posts are tagged with that tag. This helps your readers know your favorite subjects and the topics you write about most frequently.

## How to add a Tag Cloud block to your post or page

Add the *Tag Cloud block* to your post or page by clicking on the âBlock Inserterâ (+) and then search for âTag Cloudâ. Alternatively, you can type `/tag-cloud` in a new paragraph block and press `enter`.

![How to add a Tag Cloud block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/image-1.png)[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

If you have tags/categories on your site, the *Tag Cloud block* will display a list of the tags as follows:

![Preview of a Tag Cloud block](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hCtqFBzOn9j8H4JiNzQLFGYd0qkwDMJfdA08NPnuUegtBNXCCnaWDPOv8jT3NPFrBez1z6DI7WvsHbYOYAREktz040z873suDbtBKRh7Qjd6ChV6_bKrtvWWVjUbr_jjdVuI56E)If the site doesnât have any tags then it will display the message as shown below.

![When there are no tags to show, the block displays a text that says "There's no content to show here yet."](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/08/tag-clould-no-content-WP-62-1024x166.png)**Note:** Tagsâ appearance varies based on the selected theme.

## Block toolbar 

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to customize the block right in the editor. The *Tag Cloud block* offers the following options in its toolbar:

- Transform to
- Drag
- Move handles
- Change alignment
- More Options.

### Transform to

# Block Patterns <a name="documentation/article/block-pattern" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-pattern/

Block Patterns are a collection of blocks that you can insert into posts and pages and then customize with your own content. Using a Block Pattern can reduce the time required to create content on your site, as well as being a great way to learn how different blocks can be combined to produce interesting effects.

To find more patterns, you can also [use the Block Pattern Directory](#documentation/article/block-pattern-directory).

- [How to use a Block Pattern](#how-to-use-a-block-pattern)
- [How to customize a block pattern](#how-to-customize-a-block-pattern)
- [How to find contextual patterns](#contextual-patterns)
- [Resources](#resources)
- [Frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions)

Since WordPress 6.3, you can create your own patterns. Patterns work exactly the same as predefined patterns stored in the Patterns Directory. Also, with the âSyncâ option enabled, the synced pattern will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block. Editing the synced pattern will update it anywhere it is used. After creating a synced pattern, you can âDetachâ it to a regular block, and edit the block without affecting your already saved synced pattern.

WordPress 6.3 renamed Reusable Blocks to Patterns. A synced pattern will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block.

## How to use a Block Pattern

1. Click the + icon to add a new block from the top toolbar in the [WordPress Block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).
2. Click on the **Patterns** tab or Synced Patterns tab.
3. For Patterns tab, use the dropdown to choose which category of patterns you want to use or click **Explore** to open a modal that allows you to have a larger view of each pattern.
4. Either click on the pattern you wish to insert or drag and drop the pattern into your content. If you click on the pattern, it will be inserted at the location of your cursor.

## How to create a Block Pattern

Since WordPress 6.3, you can create your own patterns.

1. Select the block or blocks you want to turn into a pattern.
2. Click on the **three dot** menu that opens up the **additional settings**.
3. Click on â**Create pattern/reusable block**â.
4. Enter the name of pattern.
5. To synchronize patterns, turn on the **Sync option**. Editing the pattern will update it anywhere it is used.
6. Click Create.

Youâll then be able to locate the created patterns at **Patterns -&gt; My Pattern** or Synced Patterns (overlapping rhombus icon) of Block Inserter.

![Location of "My Patterns" within the block inserter.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/WP-6-3-create-patterns-1024x579.jpeg)## How to manage a Block Pattern

You can manage your pattern from the Site Editor.

1. Select **Appearance** -&gt; **Editor** at Administration Screen.
2. Click **Patterns**.  
    Selecting **Options** -&gt; Manage Patterns from Block Editor will open the same panel.

### How to work with patterns

You can Rename, Duplicate, Export as JSON, and Delete the pattern from Actions menu (three dot icon) of each pattern.

![Site Editor listing all custom patterns and how to edit them.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561238-782eee25-933c-4f66-95b7-439ae8022e28-6-1024x576.png)### How to edit the content of pattern

To modify a pattern, click the pattern, and click Edit (pencil icon).

### How to customize a Block Pattern

Once you insert a Block Pattern, the blocks can be edited in the same way as any other blocks.

Click on any block in the pattern, to edit the content within the block.

![Image of a block pattern showing an arrow pointing to the Replace option for the image in the pattern. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-5.22.08-PM-1024x440.png)You can also add more blocks to a Block Pattern and insert more Block Patterns to your page anywhere you want.

For the synced pattern, youâll see the synced pattern mentioned in the saving flow when you save the post or page itself. Saving will update it anywhere it is used even in other posts or pages.

![Message confirming that a patterns is about to be saved.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/wp-6-3-saving-a-pattern-1024x623.jpeg)### How to find contextual patterns

Some blocks such as the [Social Icons](#documentation/article/social-icons) block and [Query Loop](#documentation/article/query-loop-block) block have patterns built into the settings of the block. To find the contextual patterns for the **Social Icons** block, select the **Social Icon** in the **Block toolbar** and navigate to **Patterns** in the drop-down:

![Contextual patterns found in Social Icons block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/social-icons-contextual-pattern.gif)Demonstration of contextual pattern within the Social Icons block in Twenty Twenty-Two themeFor the **Query Loop** block, patterns are shown as part of the configuration of the block itself. You can learn more about the [Query Loop block here](#documentation/article/query-loop-block).

## How to find more patterns 

If you want more patterns to choose from, you can explore the [Block Pattern Directory](#patterns). This is a new directory that allows you to search and find new patterns to use on your site. After searching and finding a pattern you like, select **Copy** and it will be saved to your clipboard. From there, return to your page or post and use the **Paste** function to add the pattern to your content.

You can read more about the [Block Pattern Directory here](#documentation/article/block-pattern-directory).

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use the default images within Block Patterns on my own site?**

Yes! The images provided within Block Patterns are free to use on your site. However, because these images are being referenced from an external source (i.e. they are not added to your siteâs Media Library), there is always a chance they could change or be removed.

We recommend replacing these images with your own content but if you would like to use the ones in the patterns, please consider uploading them to your own Media Library by using the â*Upload external image*â button.

![Screenshot of an image block toolbar displaying the "upload image to media library".](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561238-782eee25-933c-4f66-95b7-439ae8022e28-7.png)When you publish a post, the pre-publish check will ask you if you want to upload external images to the media library.

![Pre-publish option for uploading all external images to media library.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/257561238-782eee25-933c-4f66-95b7-439ae8022e28-10-1024x1009.png)**Will Block Patterns be changed? Will changes to patterns that I use impact my site?**

New Block Patterns will be continuously added and existing Block Patterns may be changed or removed over time. However, once you add a Block Pattern to your site, there is no link to the original pattern in the Add Block menu, and any subsequent changes would not impact anything on your siteâs pages or posts.

# Moving blocks <a name="documentation/article/moving-blocks" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/moving-blocks/

There are three different ways to move or change the position of a block within your post or page from the admin screen of the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor): using the move handles, drag &amp; drop, or using the *Move to* option in the Block toolbar (under the More options three-dot menu).

## Using the move handles 

The move handles are the up and down arrow handles in the Block toolbar of a selected block.

![Using the move handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-07-at-9.52.18-AM.png)**NOTE**: If you set your WordPress Block Editor to display the Block toolbar pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block, then the move handles will appear right under the top toolbar.

![Using the move handles when the block toolbar is pinned to the top toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-07-at-9.51.00-AM.png)The up and down arrow icons in a Block toolbar can be used to move the selected block up and down in your post or page.

## Using the drag &amp; drop

To drag and drop the selected block to a new location on the post or page, use the rectangle of dots in the Block toolbar of the selected block.

![Using the drag and drop](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-07-at-9.58.42-AM.png)The drag and drop option is not available if you set your WordPress Block Editor to display the Block toolbar pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block.

To drag and drop the selected block, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

## Using the âMove Toâ option in the block toolbar

The *Move to* option can be found by selecting a block and clicking the three-dot menu in the block toolbar.

![Using the Move to option in the block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-07-at-10.06.38-AM-1-1024x852.png)**NOTE**: If you set your WordPress Block Editor to display the Block toolbar pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block, then the *Move to* option can be found following the same steps.

![Using the Move to option when the block toolbar is pinned to the top toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-07-at-10.19.13-AM-1-1024x835.png)On selecting the *Move to* option, you will get a blue line inside your content. You can then use the arrows to move that line, up and down to where you want the selected content to be moved. Hitting `return` on your keyboard at that point moves the block to that position

#### **Changelog** 

- Updated 2022-08-07 
    - Updated content and screenshots for 6.0
    - Added ALT tags for the images
- Updated 2022-02-16

# How to use the View feature <a name="documentation/article/how-to-use-the-preview-function" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/how-to-use-the-preview-function/

Also note that you donât need an Imgur account to embed an image, GIF or video, although it needs to be public.

![Imgur Embed block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/imgurPreview.png)Steps to embed an Imgur post in your post or page:

# Reddit embed <a name="documentation/article/reddit-embed" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reddit-embed/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

Reddit is one of the most popular websites. It hosts a considerable number of communities that share content on an astonishing number of topics. The Reddit block allows you to embed content from Reddit to your post. You do not need to have an account to be able to share the Reddit post. However, you can only embed publicly shared posts.

The screenshot below is an example of what an embed with the Reddit block may look like (in the Twenty Twenty-Three theme):

![Reddit Embed Block with image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-04-at-5.52.38-PM-1-1024x840.png)Reddit embed (with image) within the Twenty Twenty-Three themeThe example above is from an URL that contains an image. However, you can also embed posts that contain only text. In that case, your embed may look like this:

![Reddit Embed Block without image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-04-at-5.59.46-PM-1-1024x350.png)Preview of Reddit embed within the Twenty Twenty-Three theme**Steps to embed a Reddit post**

The Reddit block makes it quite simple to embed a Reddit post. These are the required steps:

1. **Go to the Reddit post you want to embed.** Please make sure itâs a public post.

![Reddit site](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-04-at-6.06.02-PM-1024x572.png)2. **Copy the URL.**  
    You can find the URL at the top of the screen (marked in red in the image below)

![Screenshot of Reddit and the correct URL to copy to use the embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-04-at-6.06.53-PM-1024x198.png)3. **Go back to your editing screen and add a Reddit block to your post.**  
    The fastest way to add a block is to use the slash command. In the empty field in the block editor type â**/reddit**â. The Reddit block will appear, and you can click to select it and add it to the post. Alternatively, [see the detailed instructions on how to add a block](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).

However, if the URL cannot be embedded, you will be notified with the message, âSorry, this content could not be embedded.â In that case, you can try to embed an alternative URL or simply add the URL as a link instead of an embed.

# Synced Patterns (Reusable blocks) <a name="documentation/article/reusable-blocks" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/

[](#documentation/article/blocks)[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

Synced pattern is a type of block pattern that enabled Synced option, and it will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block. Editing the synced pattern will update it anywhere it is used. After creating a synced pattern, you can âdetachâ it to a regular block, and edit the block without affecting your already saved synced pattern. For more information, you can learn more in the Synced Pattern article.

WordPress 6.3 renamed Reusable Blocks to Patterns. A synced pattern will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block.

## Creating a Synced Pattern

Letâs say you have a paragraph block which you often fill with the same text at the end of your post. This could be everything from how to get in touch to your business hours to your social media accounts. To avoid having to add the same content to a paragraph block every time you want to place it at the end of your post, you can make it a synced pattern. To accomplish this, follow these steps:

1. Select the block or blocks you want to turn into a pattern.
2. Click on the three dot menu that opens up the additional settings.
3. Click on âCreate patternâ.
4. Enter the name of pattern.
5. Turn on Synced option
6. Click Create.

Youâll then be able to locate the created synced patterns at Synced Patterns (crossing rhombus icon) of Block Inserter.

![The Block inserter with the "Synced Patterns" icon highlighted.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/WP-6-3-working-with-patterns.jpeg)## Using a Synced Pattern

After youâve created a Synced Pattern, you can then use it wherever youâd like. Youâll also have a few more options for adding one into your content:

- You can open up the **Block Inserter** and switch to the **Synced Patterns** section to add whichever option you want.
- Click on the add block button and search for the name of the synced pattern you want to use.
- You can type / followed by the name of the synced pattern you want to use.

After inserting the Synced Pattern you want to use, make sure to select â**Detach pattern**â (formerly known as *â***Convert to Regular Block**â) option shown below if you wish to make any changes to the block on that page or post only. Note that this option wonât be available if the Synced Pattern is locked.

![Synced Pattern Toolbar with the "Detach Pattern" option highlighted.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/wp-6-3-detach-pattern.jpeg)## Selecting and editing a Synced Pattern

If youâd like to edit a synced pattern, you can do so in two ways:

- You can add the block directly into a post or page and edit it from there. If you do this, youâll see the synced pattern mentioned in the saving flow when you save the post or page itself.
- You can go to **Options &gt; Manage Patterns**, which will take you to a specific interface where you can directly edit patterns as youâd like.

*Keep in mind that, when a synced pattern is changed, the change will be reflected in all the places where the same synced pattern was used.*

## Removing a Synced Pattern

To remove a synced pattern, click on the **three dots** icon, and select the option to **Manage Patterns**. From there you can edit and delete patterns as youâd like.

Keep in mind that, when a synced pattern is removed, the removal will be reflected in all the places where the same synced pattern was used. Youâll see the message below a where removed synced pattern existed:

![A block with a message saying "Block has been deleted or Is unavailable."](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/wp-6-3-missing-reusable-block-1024x494.jpeg)## Demonstration of a Synced Pattern

In this demo, we insert Synced Patterns in the three ways described above (Block Inserter, Add Bloock icon, â/â key). A change in one pattern (in this case, a change in text color) will be reflected in others. Next, detach the middle Synced Pattern. Synchronization is then lost. And if you look at it in the list view, it is back to a normal block.

# Group block <a name="documentation/article/group-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/group-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Group block* allows you to group different blocks together and customize them to your liking, including setting custom background colors, spacing, and more.

![Group block with columns, heading, paragraph, image and button blocks.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/group_block_layout_with_columns-1024x588.png)Example of a Group block with columns, heading, paragraph, image and button blocks.## Adding a Group block

To add a *Group block*, click on the **Block Inserter** icon.

![Adding the group block to a post or page](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/group_block_block_inserter.png)You can also type `/group` and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly. **Row and Stack are also types of Group blocks**, they just have a different layout style by default.

![Inserting a new group block using the slash keyboard command (/)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-add.png)### Block variations

When the *Group block* is created, you will find different variations to choose from: *Group, Row,* and *Stack*

![Group variation picker](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-variation-1024x328.png)### Converting multiple blocks to a Group block

You can also create a group by selecting multiple blocks. Multiple blocks can be selected by dragging your mouse. You can also select multiple blocks by holding down the âshiftâ key and using your navigation arrows or clicking on multiple blocks. Once one or more blocks have been selected, you will notice that the group icons will appear. You can click on these icons or use the âmore optionsâ button to convert them into a single group, as seen in the video below:

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

## Block toolbar

Most blocks have their own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. The *Group block* offers standard block options as well as full-width and wide-width options, if the theme supports these alignment styles.

The *Group block* shows three buttons in addition to the âGroupâ block icon.

- Moving handles
- Change alignment
- More options

### Moving handles

![Moving handles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-move.png)The up and down arrow icons can be used to shift a block up and down in your document.

Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found [here](#documentation/article/moving-blocks).

### Change alignment

![Group block alignment](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-alignment-1024x400.png)**None â** Is the default width, the same as the main content.

**Wide width** â Increase the width of the post beyond the content size.

**Full width** â Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen, if supported by your siteâs theme.

### More options 

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](#documentation/article/more-options)

## Editing the block

The nice thing about the *Group block* is that you can add any other blocks inside the group block and create a layout of your own. To add blocks to the *Group block*, click on the inserter icon inside the *Group block*.

![Adding a new block inside an existing group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-add-block-1024x434.png)## Adding content

Inside the Group block, you can add a columns block, cover block or any other available block to create the layout of your choice.

![Adding content to the group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/09/group_block_layout_with_columns-1024x588.png)The group block shown here has columns, heading, paragraph, image and button blocks.

Note that since the *Group block* has the ability to embed other blocks, if you click specifically on one of the blocks, the settings in the sidebar will change according to the block you added to the *Group block*. For example, if you added an image inside the *Group block*, when you click on the image the sidebar will display the options from the Image block settings.

![Block settings and styles](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-icon.png)Every block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the â**Settings**â icon next to the Publish/Update button*.* Within the *Group block* settings, you will see two tabs, one is for **general settings** and the other one is for **styles**.

## Group block settings

![Group Block Settings Sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-layout.png)### Alignment

There are three alignment options for the *Group block*:

- Default
- Row (Horizontal)
- Stack (Vertical)

![Group Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-group.png)![Group Block Settings (row)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-row-1.png)![Group Block Settings (stack)](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-stack.png)

If you set a block to âRowâ, you will see a number of new options to justify the items inside the row:

![horizontal alignment icons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-row-justify-1024x376.png)Items can be set to justify left, center, right or âspace between itemsâ. This last option will distribute the items inside the row to use all the available width. Additionally, by changing the âorientationâ setting, you can have your items change from flowing horizontally to flowing vertically, as illustrated in the video below.

There is a second alignment option to specify how items should align vertically.

![Vertical alignment icons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-row-vertical-alignment-1-1024x635.png)This is useful when the items inside the row have different heights, as seen in the example below:

### Layout and content width

This is an advanced option that allows you to add custom content widths to the overall *Group block* for all blocks assigned to the center or wide columns. In many cases, you wonât need to use this option. When you toggle this option on, it allows the *Group block* to inherit the options set by your theme. When itâs toggled off, you can customize to your liking.

[This article provides details about layout settings.](#documentation/article/layout-settings-overview)

### Position (sticky)

![Position: Sticky](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-sticky.png)The âPositionâ group setting allows you make a group block stick to the top of the viewport instead of scrolling, as seen in the demo below:

Please note that **only âtop levelâ Group blocks can be set as sticky**. If a Group block is embedded inside any other block, the âPositionâ setting will not be available in the settings.

### Advanced

The âAdvancedâ tab lets you specify the HTML element used for the group and add HTML anchor &amp; CSS class(es) to your block.

[![Advanced settings](#documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-advanced.png)](#documentation/files/2023/03/group-block-settings-advanced.png)The **HTML Element** option allows you to select what HTML tag you want to use for that group. You can choose between the following tags:

- Div (default)
- Header
- Main
- Section
- Article
- Aside
- Footer

**HTML anchor** allows you to [make a unique web address](#documentation/article/page-jumps) for a particular âGroupâ block. Then, youâll be able to link directly to a âGroupâ block of your page.

The **Additional CSS class(es)** area lets you add CSS class(es) to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

## Group block styles

### Color

When the group block is selected, you can see the color settings in the sidebar. You can select the text, background, and link colors to your liking.

[See this guide for more information about changing colors.](#documentation/article/colors-settings-overview)

### Border

This option allows you to set a border around the Group block, including the color, the width, radius, and the style of the border.

[Learn more about border settings.](#documentation/article/border-settings-overview)

### Dimensions

The option to control block spacing and padding is enabled for the Group block. You can read more about these settings in the

**Advanced settings**

The HTML Anchor is a useful tool for creating page jumps. If you toggle the block to its HTML view, youâll see that the HTML Anchor input is added as a CSS ID to the heading tag. You can also see the CSS class in the block HTML.

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

Based on which style you choose for the *Social Icons* block in the *Styles* settings, WordPress automatically adds a CSS class to the *Social Icons* block in the **Advanced settings** panel under **Additional CSS class(es).**

![Advanced settings with the default Styles CSS classes added by WordPress based on the Styles chosen.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-17-at-11.10.54-AM-376x1024.png)

**Color settings**

Default icons have their respective brand colors. With the *Color settings*, you can change the background and foreground color for all icons in the block to match your website branding. Pick a color from the suggestions, or add a custom color using the color picker or by adding a color code.

![Color settings in the Social Icons block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/156201029-15aed9c2-651c-4022-bcc1-1e68aa4f8832.png)**Alpha filter**

Clicking on selected color allows you to set the so-called alpha filter, which creates a certain level of color transparency.

![Alpha filter for Social icons block color settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/246114359-c595a601-d461-459e-809f-dded5b1993ac.jpg)**Background color**

Besides color settings for individual icons, it is possible to set the background color for the entire Social icons block.

[](#documentation/article/more-options)[See this guide for more information about changing colors.](#documentation/article/colors-settings-overview)

**Dimension settings**

Dimension controls are used to control how groups of blocks are placed alongside one another, by changing the values for padding, margin, and other dimensions

![Setting the block spacing for the top and bottom](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-17-at-11.19.50-AM.png)[](#documentation/article/colors-settings-overview)[Learn more about dimension controls.](#documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview)

**The block settings for individual social icons**

When you click on the individual social icons in the *Social Icons* block, you get a different set of **Block settings** in the sidebar.

**Link label**

In the Social Icon sidebar settings, you can add a Link label. The label helps screen reader users understand the context of the link.

**Advanced**

**Link rel**

A new customizable ârelâ attribute for the Social Icons block addresses the need to claim ownership of your WordPress sites on social networks.

To achieve this, these social networks require users to set a link back to their URL with the `rel="me"` attribute. With this new setting it is possible to configure the ârelâ attribute for each social icon displayed on your WordPress site.

**Additional CSS classes**

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit.

![Block settings for individual icon block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1508963/246105281-c798ae5b-8ff6-4f1e-ae01-e44ae6f650f0.png)

# Page/Post Settings sidebar <a name="documentation/article/page-post-settings-sidebar" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-post-settings-sidebar/

The Settings Sidebar is used to customize the key aspects of the page or post that is being published. Itâs an essential component of the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).

This sidebar was introduced in WordPress 5.6 and was called Document Settings. It has been renamed now to the Page/Post settings. Depending on whether you are working on a Post or Page, the tab in the sidebar is named **Post** or **Page**.

If you are working in a custom post type such as Article, this tab will be labeled with the name of the custom post type, which would be **Article** in this case. If you are in the Site Editor, the tab is named **Template**.

## How to open

![How to open Page/Post settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/Settings-Icon.png)In the upper-right corner of the WordPress Editor, select the gear icon. This toggles the sidebar. Within the sidebar, the left tab features the settings for the entire Page or Post youâre working on. The right tab shows the settings for the individual Block selected.

![Page Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/image11.png)Page Settings![Post Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/image9.png)Post Settings

## Settings Sidebar

The following sections are available in the settings sidebar for Pages and Posts. This may vary based on the themes and plugins you have on your site.

### Featured image

Featured Images (also sometimes called Post Thumbnails) are used in different ways depending on the theme. Many themes use this image to showcase the post on the home page or blog index page.

![Featured Image in Settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/chrome_ZNu0I0kE8Y.png)To set the **Featured image**, drag an image from your computer and drop it in the gray box.

You can also click the **Set featured image** box, which opens the Media Library where you can select the image or upload a new image. Once you have an image picked, you will see a blue check box around the selected image. Click **Set featured image** button at the bottom right corner to have this image as the Featured Image for the page/post.

![Adding a featured image](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-27-at-10.36.03-AM-1024x575.png)Once youâve set a Featured Image for a page or post, you have two choices available. First, you can **Replace** the current Featured Image with a new one. Second, you can **Remove** the Featured Image, so thereâs no image displayed for that page or post anymore.

![Replace and Remove Options under Featured Image Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/FeaturedImage_Update-1.png)### Excerpt

This section is optional and only applicable to post types that have excerpts enabled, such as posts. Here you can write a one to two sentence description of the post.

![Excerpt in the Settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/image5-1.png)Depending on the theme, these excerpts can be used as a preview, in place of showing the full post or page content on different places such as the homepage, search results, or the archive page.

If the excerpt is empty, WordPress automatically creates an excerpt using the first 55 words of the post.

#### Status 

This setting controls the Status of the page/post and how it is viewed once it is published.

Clicking on the current setting for **Status** will open a pop-over where you can change the Status &amp; Visibility setting. Click **X** in the top right corner in the pop-over to close it.

![Status Settings

- **Pending:** The pending review checkmark indicates that the page/post is ready for someone to review it. Posts that are pending review are marked as **Pending** in the list of posts and will also show up in the filter under **Pending**. This check box will NOT be available once a page/post is published.

![Pending review posts in the Pending filter](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/chrome_i4iNC7fxIb.png)- **Private:** Only visible to site admins and editors.

![Slug Settings ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/image2-1.png)Clicking on the current setting for the **Slug** will open a pop-over where you can change the settings. Click **X** in the top right corner in the pop-over to close it.

If you have your [Permalink settings](#documentation/article/using-permalinks#choosing-your-permalink-structure) to *Plain*, you will NOT have the option to customize the URL. the U pretty permalinks for draft and schedule posts.

- **Permalink:** Once your post or page is saved as a draft, you can edit the last part of the URL (also called the **Slug**). Depending on your [Permalink settings](#documentation/article/using-permalinks#choosing-your-permalink-structure), the **Slug** will be appended to the end of your siteâs URL. For example: https://example.com/**\[slug\]**
- The **Slug** is automatically pre-populated as a URL-friendly version of your post/page title. To change that, you can type into the **Permalink** text field.

- **View Post:** The link here is the complete URL of the post once itâs published. Clicking on this link will open the post or page in a new tab.

#### Author

This setting will show the author of the page/post. If you have enough permission, you can change the author by selecting a different author from the dropdown list.

![Author Setting](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/image4-1.png)#### Template

### Discussion

Here you can control how people interact with your post through comments.

![Discussion in the settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/image7.png)- You can turn on comments on the Post by checking **Open**.
- You can also turn on [pingbacks](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging) and [trackbacks](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging) by checking **Enable pingbacks &amp; trackbacks**. Trackbacks and Pingbacks both aim to provide some verification to blog commenting. *This feature is only available for Posts.*

#### Post format

This feature is only available for Posts AND on certain themes only. In some themes, like Twenty Sixteen, there is a dropdown menu for Post Format. A Post Format is used by a theme for presenting posts in a certain style. Refer to your themeâs documentation for how each Post Format will show up on your site.

![Post formats](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-27-at-11.32.08-AM.png)### Parent

This section allows you to set parent pages and change the order of your pages. This feature is only available for hierarchical post types, such as Pages.

![Parent attributes in the settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/11/chrome_PRyEpRDS5n.png)- Using **Parent Pages** is a good way to organize your site Pages into hierarchies. A parent page is a top-level page, with child pages nested under it. Clicking inside the **Parent Page** text box will show the pages on the site in the hierarchy. You can select any page to be the top-level Page with the current Page as its child.
- You can change the order that your pages are displayed when using a default menu by using the **Order** field. This sets the order in which your Pages are displayed in the Page hierarchy.

#### Move to trash

Once the post or page is saved for the first time as a draft, a new button will appear named **Move to trash**. This button will continue to show up in the sidebar for a page/post that is pending review, scheduled, or published. Once an item is placed into the trash, it remains there for 30 days (by default), then is permanently deleted.

![Move to trash feature in Post](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/Move-to-Trash.gif)### Categories

Each post in WordPress is filed under one or more [Categories](#documentation/article/posts-categories-screen). Categories provide a helpful way to group related blog posts together. They not only help keep posts organized, but you can also use categories to display posts in several places across your site, making it easier for your visitors to find what theyâre looking for quickly.

On the Settings sidebar for Posts, a list of your categories will show up with checkboxes. Add your post to one or more categories by checking the checkbox next to the Category name.

![Categories settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-27-at-9.38.20-AM.png)To add a new category, click **Add New Category** to open a new panel.

- Type a name for the **New Category**.
- Select a **Parent Category** for the New Category. Each Category may be assigned to a Parent Category, allowing you to set a hierarchy within the Category structure.
- Click the **Add New Category** button.

### Tags

Tags provide a useful way to group related posts together and quickly tell your readers what a post is about. Tags also make it easier for people to find your content. Each post in WordPress can be filed under one or more Tags. Unlike Categories, Tags are not required.

![Tags in Settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-27-at-10.30.42-AM.png)By default, this feature is only available for posts.

- To add a new tag to your post, type in the text box **Add New Tag**. Then press `Enter` or `Return` on your keyboard.
- If the tag has already been created for a previous post, the Tags box will begin to auto-populate with matching tags.
- To remove a tag, click on the **X** to the right of the tag.

If you have more than 3 tags that you frequently use on your Posts, they will be displayed under **Most Used**. Clicking on any one of them will add it to the current Post.

![Tags in Settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-27-at-1.20.08-PM.png)## How to customize

You can change which sections appear in the sidebar of the WordPress Editor by using the [Preferences](#documentation/article/preferences-overview) tool.

## The Site Editor Settings Sidebar

The settings sidebar in the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor) (**only** available if your site is using a [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes)) is shown below:

![Settings sidebar in site editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-27-at-2.25.23-PM.png)- You can find the name of the Template and what itâs purpose is. Under **Areas,** the Template Parts that make up the Template are listed.
- Clicking on any one of the Template Parts in the list will navigate you to where that Template Part is located on the template page. It will also open up a new panel in the sidebar showing the details for that Template Part as shown below:

![Customizing the template part in the sidebar settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-27-at-4.35.19-PM.png)- Under the **Advanced** section, you can change the Title, Area, HTML element for the Template Part and also add additional CSS classes.
- If you are viewing a template that came bundled with your block theme and you have made changes to the template, you can clear the customizations by clicking the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the Template settings sidebar. This will open a drop-down menu. Select **Clear customizations**. This will reset the template to the default state and you will lose the changes you made to that template.

# Where to find WordPress help <a name="documentation/article/where-to-find-wordpress-help" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/where-to-find-wordpress-help/

**Important:** Please note that this is not a support page. If you seek help with your specific problem, please refer to the [Support forums](#support/welcome).

WordPress help is never hard to find. There are many sites dedicated to helping WordPress users, including this support page and the always-helpful [forums](#support/forums). With so much content available, however, how are you to know where to begin looking for help?

The [WordPress FAQ](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ), which provides comprehensive answers to common questions, is a good place to start. You could also read our document on [using the WordPress forums](#support/welcome) to help you get better results from your support requests.

However, the best place to start looking for WordPress help is your favorite search engine. This is usually the quickest way to get the information you need, and helps take some of the pressure off our volunteers in the support forums.

## Searching The Net For WordPress Help

When searching online for WordPress help, one of the biggest challenges can be figuring out the right keywords to use. Otherwise, you risk spending an inordinate amount of time sorting through search results that donât accurately reflect the problem that you are currently experiencing. In order to quickly get the information that you need, it makes sense to limit your search to specific online WordPress resources or websites. The following section will show you how to choose the right search terms, and how to use those terms effectively.

### Search Using Keywords

Sometimes you can use error messages to generate the keywords needed in your help search. For example:

```
Warning: main(/home/atlantis/public_html/wp-includes/
functions.php): failed to open stream: No such
file or directory in /home/stargateatlantis/
public_html/wp-settings.php on line 67

Fatal error: main(): Failed opening required
'/home/atlantis/public_html/wp-includes/
functions.php' (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:
/usr/local/lib/php') in /home/stargateatlantis/
public_html/wp-settings.php on line 67
```

The keywords you need to help solve the problem are hidden within this information. In particular, the error specifically references the files that are causing the issue: functions.php and wp-settings.php. The names of these files will make up part of your search.

You could try opening the files directly to examine them. However, this may be of limited use. Due to the way that WordPress processes .php files, the given line numbers may not correspond to the actual source of the error.

The specific errors are **failed to open stream** and **failed opening required**, with both happening inside the wp-settings.php file. This indicates that the problem is likely with wp-settings.php rather than functions.php. The fact that both errors contain the words âfailedâ and âopenâ is another clue.

Armed with this information, create a search in your favorite search engine that includes the words:

```
wordpress failed open wp-settings.php
```

This should get you started on narrowing down the problem.

Not all keywords can be found so easily. If the problem is a CSS or HTML issue, you can include the [specific tag](https://codex.wordpress.org/Finding_Your_CSS_Styles) or selector with which the problem seems to lie. However, it is still advisable to include actual words in your search, as it can be difficult to figure out which tag is causing the actual issue.

You may need to analyze the problem for a minute or two to in order to find the right terms. For example, if your web page layout looks noticeably different in Internet Explorer than it does in another browser, then search for information on **Internet Explorer layout bugs**. On the other hand, if you have a layout error that remains consistent among browsers, identify the part of the layout that is affected. Is it the **sidebar**, **header**, **post content**, or **comments**? Likewise, if the header image is not showing up or is not displaying correctly, begin by searching for **wordpress header image** and then add specifics such as **wordpress header image missing** to narrow things down.

### Brainstorming Search Terms

Brainstorming is a useful technique to use if you are struggling to find suitable keywords. To start, write down the problem you are experiencing, trying to be as descriptive as possible. For example:

> *Iâm having trouble with the nested list in the sidebar of my layout. It isnât lining up the items under the titles right. It is keeping things on the left margin when I want them to be indented.*

Your description can be a good source of potential keywords. In the above example, you can find:

- sidebar
- layout
- nested list
- left margin
- indented

All of these terms could be used as search keywords.

Alternatively, explain your problem to a non-WordPress user. Stating the issue in simple terms is an excellent way to get to the heart of a problem and find the right keywords to summarize the issue.

### Search Engine Site Search

Once you have selected your keywords, itâs time to put them to work. As you sort through the search results, you may end up replacing your initial keywords with more specific ones, in order to narrow down the results. For example, while searching for âwordpress sidebar layout nested linksâ, you may discover that the problem lies within the specific [theme](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes) you are using. Add the name of the theme to your keywords in order to narrow down your search.

Another way to improve the quality of your search results is to search a specific site, rather than the entire internet. Most search engines allow you to run a search across one specific web address, helping you to avoid irrelevant results.

#### Google, Yahoo, and Bing Site Search

Google, Yahoo, and Bing all support use of the âsite:â function while searching. To search a specific domain via one of these search engines, type your keywords and specify the site you want to search using the format âsite:\[domain\]â. For example:

```
keyword1 keyword2 site:wordpress.org
```

This instructs the search engine to search all **wordpress.org** sites, such as *codex.wordpress.org*, *wordpress.org/support*, and *make.wordpress.org*.

To narrow your search down to a specific site, such as *codex.wordpress.org*, enter:

```
keyword1 keyword2 site:codex.wordpress.org
```

This instructs the search engine to search only the codex.wordpress.org site, which wonât include results from the Support Forums.

#### Other Search Engines

Other search engines provide different ways to narrow down searches. Check to see if there is an advanced search option for your favorite search engine, and take your search from there.

### Use Quotes to Group Keywords

You can narrow your search by grouping different keywords together. For example, instead of looking for:

```
sidebar layout nested list left margin indented
```

you could group key phrases together with quote marks:

```
sidebar layout "nested list" "left margin" indented
```

This would limit your search to anything with the words *sidebar*, *layout*, and *indented*, and the phrases â*nested list*â and â*left margin*.â

Most search engines also allow you to use Boolean references such as **AND**, **OR** and **NOT** to group keywords together. For example, searching for:

```
"left margin" OR "nested list"
```

would return a list of pages containing either the phrase *âleft marginâ* or *ânested listâ*, as well as pages containing both of those terms.

## WordPress Sources for Help

The best way to find accurate and concise WordPress information is to get it directly from WordPress.org sites. The main places to go for WordPress help and support are:

- [WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page) â WordPress Online Manual
- [WordPress Support Forums](https://www.wordpress.org/support/)
- [IRC Libera WordPress Support on channel #wordpress](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC)
- [WordPress IRC Live Help](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_IRC_Live_Help)

## Other Helpful Resources

- Search the [WordPress Support Forums](#support) for the self-hosted version of WordPress, and the [WordPress.com Support Forum](http://wordpress.com/support/) for help with WordPress.com issues. Please read [Using the Support Forums](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_Support_Forums) and **Finding WordPress Help** to find out how to search the forums and post a clear, answerable question.
- [Learn WordPress](http://learn.wordpress.com/) is the official WordPress.com tutorial and online video help site. Many tutorials apply to the self-hosted version of WordPress as well.
- To learn more about PHP (the open source scripting language that WordPress is built upon) try [this article](http://www.w3schools.com/php/).
- Use Live WordPress Support via IRC. See: [WordPress IRC Live Help](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_IRC_Live_Help) and [IRC](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC).
- If all else fails, go to the [WordPress Trac](https://trac.wordpress.org/) (bug tracker) and search the database to see if your problem has already been addressed. If you think your problem merits a new bug report, file one.

**Important:** Please note that this is not a support page. If you seek help with your specific problem, please refer to the [Support forums](#support/welcome).

# Vimeo embed <a name="documentation/article/vimeo-embed" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/vimeo-embed/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

Vimeo is a popular video-sharing service. With the Vimeo block, you can embed videos from Vimeo into your WordPress website. You donât need a Vimeo account to be able to use it. You can only embed all public Vimeo videos.

When embedded, a Vimeo video would look like this inside your WordPress post or page.

**Embedded Vimeo Video**:

![Vimeo Embed example ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-28-58-1024x576.png)**Steps to Embed a Vimeo Video**:

**1. Find the URL of the Vimeo video**

Find your video on vimeo.com, and copy the URL of the video from the browser bar.

![How to get the vimeo video URL ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/03/image10.png)**2. Add a Vimeo Embed block to your post**

![How to quickly add a vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-34-28.png)[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

**3. Paste the Vimeo URL *from Step 1***

![Paste the video link into the text box.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-36-30-1024x637.png)**4. Click the *Embed* button**

If itâs a link that can be successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

![Preview of the vimeo  Block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-38-30-1.png)If you use a URL that canât be embedded, the block shows the message *âSorry, this content could not be embedded.â*

![Error message when you cannot embed a URL in the SoundCloud block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-43-04-1-1024x684.png)You will have two choices: Try again with a different URL or convert to link.

**5. Youâll see the Vimeo player on your WordPress editor if you successfully embed a Vimeo video**

![Preview in the Vimeo video ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/155064604-ae7c6863-7102-4f2a-aa38-2bfc3ad8190d-1024x576.png)## Block Toolbar

Besides the Mover and Drag &amp; Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for Vimeo embed shows four buttons:

- Transform to
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More Options

![Block toolbar in the vimeo video block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/154611389-012a95a5-dabb-448a-8323-ba52144952be-1.png)**Transform to**

![Transform option in the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/154611481-81e9e9fd-f127-4b55-989d-facf2a5701ad-1.png)You can transform a Vimeo embed block into a Group. This would give you the ability to change the background color around the Vimeo embed.

![Vimeo block inside the group block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-03-01_12-51-20-1024x489.png)Editor view of a Vimeo embed as a group with Color Settings controls![Vimeo embed with a gray background-color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/2022-02-21_22-59-13-1-1024x576.png)Vimeo embed with a gray background-color**Change Alignment**

![Change alignment in the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/154611609-181208d6-8a52-4813-9418-8df683e4cdd9-1.png)- **None** â Default alignment option.
- **Wide width** â Increase the width of the post beyond the content size.
- **Full width** â Extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.
- **Align left** â Make the block left-aligned.
- **Align center** â Make the block alignment centered.
- **Align right** â Make the block right aligned.

**Edit URL**

Via the **Edit URL**, you can change the Vimeo Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the **Embed** button.

![Edit URL in the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/03/154611683-c2f565bf-f547-4b2e-8264-921b61b190fe.png)**More options**

These controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.

[Read about these and other settings.](#documentation/article/more-options)

## Block Settings

![Block settings for the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/03/image3-edited-3.png)Besides the Advanced section, the Vimeo embed has only one setting in the âBlock Settingsâ sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Media settings turned off in the vimeo block and Media settings turned on in the vimeo block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/pasted-image-0-15-1.png)Via the *Media Settings*, you can control the behavior of your post embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is âonâ or blue.

**âOff:â** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**âOn:â** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the âOnâ position.

**Advanced**

![The advanced section lets you add a CSS class to your block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/07/image-77.png)The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit. For a Vimeo embed there are default CSS classes to allow for responsive handling of the embed when viewed on smaller devices like mobile phones.

    - Removed redundant content
    - Added alt text to images

# Trackbacks and Pingbacks <a name="documentation/article/trackbacks-and-pingbacks" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/trackbacks-and-pingbacks/

Trackbacks and pingbacks are methods for alerting blogs that you have linked to them. The difference between them is:

- **Trackbacks** â must be created manually, and send an excerpt of the content.
- **Pingbacks** â are automated and donât send any content.

Check out the [article on the WordPress user document](#documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging) for a more detailed explanation.

## Pingbacks

A pingback is a type of comment thatâs created when you link to another blog post where pingbacks are enabled. The best way to think about pingbacks is as remote comments:

- Person A posts something on his blog.
- Person B posts on her own blog, linking to Person Aâs post. This automatically sends a pingback to Person A when both have pingback enabled blogs.
- Person Aâs blog receives the pingback, then automatically goes to Person Bâs post to confirm that the pingback did, in fact, originate there.

To create a pingback, just link to another blog post. If that post has pingbacks enabled, the blog owner will see a pingback appear in their comments section that they can approve. Comments are styled differently for each theme. Here is an example of how a pingback appears:

![pingback-example](https://support.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/pingback-example.jpg)### Can I stop self-pings?

Yes. Self-pings (pings within your own blog) are found useful by some, annoying by others. Those who find them useful feel that if someone finds the old post that they will see the link to the new post. But some still disagree. Normally when you create a link, the entire URL including `http://` is used. That will cause a self-ping. To prevent self-pings, shorten the URL from

```
http://example.com/2021/06/16/twitter-widget
```

to

```
/2021/06/16/twitter-widget
```

Note: Editorâs visual mode may add the domain information back into the link. To check that, you must switch to the HTML mode and make sure the link is displayed correctly in the href attribute for the link before publishing.

### Disabling Pingbacks

You can easily disable pingbacks on individual posts via the Discussion metabox on your Add New or Edit Post page:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/pingbacks-disabled.jpg)## Trackbacks

Trackbacks are a way to notify legacy blog systems that youâve linked to them. If you link to a WordPress blog theyâll be notified automatically using pingbacks, no other action necessary. Think of trackbacks as the equivalent of acknowledgements and references at the end of an academic paper or chapter in a text book. To send a trackback, add the trackback URI from the other blog post to the Send Trackbacks module in your blog post before you publish it. A trackback URI from a WordPress blog will end with /trackback/.

### How do I send a Trackback (Classic Editor Only)

Go to the post on the other personâs blog and look for the âTrackback URIâ or similar.

![trackbacks0](https://support.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/trackbacks0.png) Once you have that link you need to copy the URL of the link. In Chrome, Right-click on the link and **Copy Link Address**.

Back on your blog, scroll down from the editor to the **Trackbacks** module and paste the URL into that box. If the blog where it was copied from is a WordPress blog, the URL will end with /trackback/.

![trackbacks3](https://support.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/trackbacks3.png) Publish your post and the trackback will be sent. Please note that your trackback might be sent but the receiving site may choose not to display it.

# Site Health screen <a name="documentation/article/site-health-screen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-health-screen/

Site Health screen is located in your dashboard under **Tools** &gt; **Site Health** &gt; **Info**.

WordPress offers a diagnosis of your siteâs health. There are two tabs on the site health screen:

1\. Status:

The status tab allows you to see critical information about your WordPress configuration, along with anything else that requires your attention.

2\. Info:

The info tab is a granular view of the technical aspects of your WordPress website. You can see detailed information about every aspect of your site such as themes, plugins, and media. There is also a useful export feature that allows you to copy all of the information about your site to the clipboard.

Find more detailed information on both tabs below.

## Status

The site health check shows critical information about your WordPress configuration and items that require your attention. Information is grouped by severity: critical issues recommended improvements and passed tests.

### Critical issues

Critical issues refer to parts of your website that can be potential security vulnerabilities or serious performance issues; suggesting how to fix them. Some of the possible critical issues are:

**Auto-updates for plugins and/or themes appear to be disabled, but settings are still set to be displayed.**

This could cause auto-updates to not work as expected.  
Type: Security

[Learn more about auto-updates for plugins and themes](#documentation/article/plugins-themes-auto-updates)

**Background updates are not working as expected.**

Background updates ensure that WordPress can auto-update if a security update is released for the version you are currently using.

[Configuring automatic updates  
  ](#documentation/article/configuring-automatic-background-updates)**Could not reach WordPress.org**

Communicating with the WordPress servers is required to check for new versions, and install and update WordPress core, themes, or plugins. This message means your site is unable to reach WordPress.org at api.wordpress.org

**File upload**

file\_uploads is set to 0. You wonât be able to upload files on your site.

The ini\_get() function has been disabled, some media settings are unavailable because of this.

**HTTP requests are blocked**

HTTP requests have been blocked by the WP\_HTTP\_BLOCK\_EXTERNAL constant, with no allowed hosts.

Site maintainers can now block all, or some, communication to other sites and services. If set up incorrectly, this may prevent plugins and themes from working as intended.

![Message: HTTP requests are blocked](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image9.png)**Your site is set to display errors to site visitors**

Debug mode is often enabled to gather more details about an error or site failure, but may contain sensitive information which should not be available on a publicly available website.

The value, WP\_DEBUG\_DISPLAY, has either been enabled by WP\_DEBUG or added to your configuration file. This will make errors display on the front end of your site.

![Message: Your site is set to display errors to site visitors ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image21.png)**Your site is set to log errors to a potentially public file**

Debug mode is often enabled to gather more details about an error or site failure but may contain sensitive information which should not be available on a publicly available website.

The value, WP\_DEBUG\_LOG, has been added to this websiteâs configuration file. This means any errors on the site will be written to a file that is potentially available to all users.

[Learn more about debugging in WordPress](#documentation/article/debugging-in-wordpress)

**Your site could not complete a loopback request**

Loopback requests are used to run scheduled events and are also used by the built-in editors for themes and plugins to verify code stability.

![Message: Your site could not complete a loopback request](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image14.png)**PHP default timezone is invalid**

PHP default timezone was changed after WordPress was loaded. This interferes with the calculations of dates and times.

**One or more required modules are missing**

The required module, json\_last\_error, is not installed or has been disabled.

**An active PHP session was detected**

A PHP session was created by a session\_start() function call. This interferes with REST API and loopback requests. The session should be closed by session\_write\_close() before making any HTTP requests.

![Message: An active PHP session was detected](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image16.png)**Your site is running an outdated version of PHP, which requires an update**

PHP is the programming language used to build and maintain WordPress. Newer versions of PHP are created with increased performance in mind, so you may see a positive effect on your siteâs performance

Type: Security

![Message: Your site is running an outdated version of PHP, which requires an update](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image8.png)**You have plugins waiting to be updated**

Plugins extend your siteâs functionality with things like contact forms, eCommerce, and much more. That means they have deep access to your site, so itâs vital to keep them up to date.

![Message: You have plugins waiting to be updated](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/06/image4.png)### Recommended improvements

Recommended improvements section lists all the items that are not critical for your website but should be modified for better security and performance.

### Passed tests

The passed tests section lists all the other items that are tested by the Site Health tool and showing no issues.

## Info

The site health info screen contains details about the configuration of your WordPress site. For example, here you can find information on which version of WordPress you are using or the number of active and inactive plugins and themes you have. But, this screen also contains technical information about your server setup, your database, and your permissions. Note that the screen only contains information. So, you cannot configure any of the settings from it.

# Template Editor <a name="documentation/article/template-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-editor/

The Template Editor allows you to edit and create templates, using [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks). These templates control the layout of the posts, pages, or page types on your site.

The Template Editor is **only** available if your site is using a [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) or a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend.

## About Templates

WordPress uses templates to create the layout and structure for posts, pages, or specific page types on your site page. There are a few base templates that are generated when you select a theme. For example:

- The **Home** template is used to display the siteâs home page if your site is set up to display the [latest posts ](#documentation/article/settings-reading-screen)on the home page.
- The **Index** template is used to display the index page of all the blog posts.
- The **Page** template is used to display the siteâs pages if no specific templates are assigned to the page.
- Many block themes offer other built-in templates like the **Single Post** template to customize the layout of single blog posts, the **404** template to customize the layout of the 404 error page, the **Search** template to customize the layout of the search results page, and the **Archive** template for categories/archives page, etc.

In addition, your [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) may come bundled with custom templates.

In the Template Editor, you can find all the templates on your site, including any custom templates you created and the ones that came bundled with your theme. You can edit these templates and create custom layouts using [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks).

When you make changes to a template, the editor updates the blocks on all pages/posts that use the template. These changes take precedence over your themeâs bundled template files.

## What you need, to use the Template Editor

To work with the Template Editor, you need to use a [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) on your site. A block theme is a theme that uses [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer.

All [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) that are available in the [WordPress Block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) can be used in the Template Editor. To find block themes, from the WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance** &gt; **Themes** and click **Add New**. In the **Add Themes** page, select **Block Themes** to find the growing list of [Block themes](#documentation/article/block-themes) in the [WordPress theme directory](#themes/tags/full-site-editing).

![How to find a block theme](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-9.36.15-AM-2-1024x493.png)How to find a block themeOnce you install and activate a Block theme on your site, go to **Appearance** &gt; **Editor** to open the Site Editor.

## Two ways to access the Template Editor

There are two different ways you can access the Template Editor depending on what type of theme you are using:

- If you are using a [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes), you can access the Template Editor when editing posts or pages via the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) and also via the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor).
- If you are using a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend, you can access the Template Editor only when editing posts or pages via the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).

This is helpful, for example, if you want to show a grid of posts for a specific âphotographyâ category but not change the default list style for others.

To create a custom category template, select **Category** from the drop-down menu, after you choose to add a new template. A new dialog will appear with two choices:

**Category** â for creating a custom template for an individual category. Selecting this option will open a new dialog listing all the categories on your site. . If your site has more than **10** Categories, the dialog box will also show a Search box and you can search by the Category name to find the one you are looking for.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/Screenshot-2023-08-08-at-2.40.36-pm-1024x580.png)Creating template for specific categoryOnce you make your choice between All Categories or Categories you will be taken to the Template Editor, where you can design the layout of the template.

To create a custom author template, select **Author** from the drop-down menu, after you click on the **Add New** button in the Template Editor. This will open up a dialog where you can choose between creating one template for all the authors (**All Authors**) or a specific template for a certain author(**Author**). If you choose a specific template for an author, you will be prompted to choose from the list of authors on your site.

This will open up a dialog where you can choose between creating one template for all the Posts (**All Posts**) or a specific template for a certain Post (**Post**). If you choose a specific template for a Post, you will be prompted to choose from the list of Posts on your site.

Archive and Single item: If your site has Custom Post Types, like testimonials, movies, books, or recipes, you will also be able to create a separate template for their archive pages or single posts.

For eg: to create a custom archive template for a specific custom post type eg: Testimonial, select **Archive: Testimonial** from the drop-down menu, after you choose to add a new template. This will open the Template Editor pre-populated with the content of the Custom Post Type. This means you would be presented with content already in the template rather than starting from scratch. You can design the layout further by adding or removing blocks from the template.

Selecting this option will open a new dialog listing all the items on your site for that Custom Post Type (in this example **Testimonial**). Once you make your choice between All or Single Item for the Custom Post Type you will be taken to the Template Editor, where you can design the layout of the template.

A custom template can be assigned to any post, page, or custom post type.

When you add a new template from the list of choices provided in the Template Editor, they are automatically assigned to their respective page, post, or post type. For eg: The Author template gets automatically assigned to posts based on authors. When you create a new custom template, it is not assigned to anything specific until you assign a template to the post or page.

To create a custom template, select **Custom Template** from the drop-down menu, after you choose to add a new template. In the dialog that appears, give a name for the new custom template and click **Create**. Make sure the name describes the template eg: Post with sidebar.

- This will open a dialog box where you can type in a new name for the custom template you selected. Make sure the name describes the template eg: Post with sidebar.
- Click **Save** to save the custom template with the new name.

1. In the detail view you will see an additional âcustomizedâ label on templates with customizations.
2. When viewing the details of the template you will see a note indicating when the template was last updated, at the bottom of the details column.

# Block-based Widgets Editor <a name="documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor/

The Block-based Widgets Editor brings the power of blocks to the **Theme Customizer** and **Appearance** &gt; **Widgets** sections in the WordPress Administration Screens allowing you to add blocks right next to any current widgets. You can now customize your Widget Areas using blocks, just like how you use the [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) to create content.

The Block-based Widgets Editor was introduced in 5.8 for those who use classic themes with [widgets](#documentation/article/wordpress-widgets). With WordPress 5.8 or higher and a classic theme like [Twenty Twenty](#documentation/article/twenty-twenty), you can see the Block-based Widgets Editor.

![Block-based Widgets Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/07/test-widgets_v2-1-1024x643.jpeg)Appearance &gt; Widgets View![Widget area in the Customizer](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/07/test-widgets-customizer-1-1024x643.jpeg)Customizer View## How to use blocks in the Widget editor

The interface replicates the [Post Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) experience, allowing you to use similar workflows like drag and drop. The biggest difference is that you will see distinct editing areas that represent the various Widget Areas as part of your theme, like Footer and Sidebar.

Within each of these areas, you can add blocks like you would in the Post Editor. You can edit any previous Widgets youâve added using the **Legacy Widgets** block. Of note, [Theme blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) (Site Logo, Site Title, etc) and [Synced patterns](#documentation/article/reusable-blocks) have been disabled in this editor.

**How to add a block**

1. Navigate to **Appearance** &gt; **Widgets**.
2. Click on a specific Widget Area youâd like to edit.
3. Select the **+** prompt to add a block. You can use the search functionality to find the block you want or select **Browse All** to see the various options.

**How to move items between areas**

There are two ways to move items between areas:

1. You can use drag and drop by hovering over the block toolbar, selecting and holding it, and dragging it to a new section.
2. You can use the option shown below in the block toolbar to move to the desired Widget Area:

![Block widget mover](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-06-at-8.36.47-PM-1-edited.png)## How to use blocks in the Customizer

If youâre more comfortable managing your Widget Areas in the Customizer, you can now add widgets and blocks with the same ability to live preview, schedule changes, and publish that youâre used to. The main thing to keep in mind is that, due to the small size of the Customizer, some settings require a few more steps to find. To find all block settings, follow the steps below:

1. Use the **+** to add a new block.
2. After adding the block, select the three-dot ellipsis menu and choose the top option of **Show more settings**.
3. From there, youâll see more options to customize your block to your liking.

## How to manage Legacy Widgets

For any widget that doesnât come with WordPress and that hasnât been converted to a block, you can use the Legacy Widget block to manage any existing widgets or third-party widgets.

## How to opt-out

A user may install and activate [the Classic Widgets plugin](#plugins/classic-widgets) to opt-out of this feature. This will return you to the [original view](#documentation/article/appearance-widgets-screen) of the **Appearance** &gt; **Widgets** and the **Customizer**.

# Query Loop block <a name="documentation/article/query-loop-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/query-loop-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Query Loop block* is an advanced block that allows you to display posts based on specified parameters, like a PHP loop without the code. You can think of it as a more complex and powerful [*Latest Posts Block*](#documentation/article/latest-posts-block). With various block patterns integrated into the block setup, you can do things like create a portfolio or a page full of your favorite recipes.

![Query loop block in the editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/query-loop-main.png)To add the *Query Loop* block to a page, click the **block inserter** (+) icon to open the block inserter pop-up window and choose the *Query Loop* block.

![Adding a query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/adding-query-loop-pattern.gif)You can also use the keyboard shortcut /query-loop to quickly insert a *Query Loop* block.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

## Block configuration

After adding the *Query Loop* block you will see two options:

- **Choose**
- **Start blank**

![Query loop block placeholder](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/placeholder-1.png)### How to choose a pattern

If you select the *Choose* option, you will have various pattern options. Just select one that you like, and it will be added. Each *Query Loop block* is made up of various nested blocks, like the *Post Title block* and [*Pagination block*](#documentation/article/pagination-block), so depending on which pattern you choose, nested blocks can differ.

![Choosing a query loop block pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/query-loop-pattern.png)### How to start blank

If you select the *Start blank* option, youâll see four variations you can choose from. Select the one you want to use.

![Adding a blank query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/adding-blank-query-loop.gif)### How to customize the appearance

There are numerous ways to customize the *Query Loop block,* partially because itâs made up of nested blocks that you can rearrange, add to, and more. When you customize one block in the *Query Loop block*, the changes will apply to all blocks of the same type. While customizing this block, it might help to use the List View found in the top toolbar. Here are some ideas for customization to get you started:

- You can **change the width** of various aspects of the *Query Loop block*.
- You can **change the alignmen**t of blocks within the *Query Loop* *block.*
- You can **add blocks** into the *Query Loop block*, like *Post Author* or *Post Excerpt*.
- You can **rearrange the blocks** to your liking, dragging and dropping or using the movers to do so.
- You can **change the number of posts** listed by selecting the *Query Loop block* and adjusting the Display Settings option in the block toolbar.
- You can **set various color options** for the nested blocks.
- You can **add featured images** by adding the *Featured Image block*.

Itâs also possible to add text or blocks when the *Query Loop* block returns no results:

![No results text for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/no-results.png)## Block toolbar

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block has unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The *Query Loop* block shows nine buttons in the block toolbar:

![Query loop block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/toolbar-2.png)- Transform to
- Drag icon
- Move arrows
- Align
- Display settings
- Replace
- List view/Grid view
- More options

### Transform to

![Transform to tool for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/transform-4.png)Click on the âTransformâ button to convert the *Query Loop* block into a âGroupâ or âColumnsâ block.

### Drag icon

![Drag tool for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/drag-and-drop.png)To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page template, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag it to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

### Move arrows

![Move handles for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/arrows-2.png)The up and down arrow icons can be used to move the block up and down on the page.

Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found [here](#support/article/moving-blocks)

### Align

![Alignment tool for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/block-alignment.png)Use the change alignment tool to align the *Query Loop* block. Choose one of the following options:

- **None â** leaves the block the current size.
- **Wide width â** increase the width of the block beyond the content size.
- **Full width â** extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.

The âWide widthâ and âFull widthâ alignment settings must be enabled by your WordPress theme.

### Display settings

![Display settings for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/display-settings.png)Use the display settings tool to change various options for the *Query Loop* block. Choose one of the following options:

- **Items per Page** â Choose how many posts you want to show within the *Query Loop block*.
- **Offset** â Enable the *Query Loop block* to skip a certain number of WordPress posts before starting output.
- **Max page to show** â Limits how many pieces of content to show.

If you donât see this section, itâs because you need to toggle off the âInherit query from templateâ setting.

### Replace

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/replace.png)Use the replace option to replace the current pattern with a new one.

### List view (default)

Displays your post in a stacked list.

![List view tool for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/list-view-2-1024x771.png)### Grid view

Displays your posts in a grid view.

![Grid view tool for query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/grid-view-1024x550.png)## Options

The Options button on a block toolbar gives you more features to customize the block.

[Read about these and other settings.](#support/article/more-options)

## Block Settings

The block settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the settings icon next to the **Publish/Update** button.

![Block settings button in the editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/block-settings-1.png)Here are the options for the *Query Loop* block:

### Color

Starting from WordPress 6.2, the Query Loop block will no longer support color settings. As a result, you will need to change the colors of the individual blocks that are within the *Query Loop* block instead:

![Customizing query loop block color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/color.png)[](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)[See this guide for more information about changing colors.](#documentation/article/colors-settings-overview)

### Inner blocks use content width

This option allows you to configure justification, content, and wide width settings for all nested blocks within the Query *Loop* block.

![Customizing query loop block with content width](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/query-loop-layout-settings.gif)### Inherit query from template

This is an option you can toggle on and off, depending on whether you want to customize the query the loop relies upon. WordPress will otherwise rely on the template being used to determine what posts appear. If you toggle it on, certain customization options will be hidden. If you toggle it off, more customization options will appear.

### Post type

WordPress contains different types of content, and they are divided into collections called âPost typesâ. By default, there are a few different ones, such as blog posts and pages, but plugins could add more.

### Order by

- Newest to Oldest (default)
- Oldest to Newest
- Alphabetical A to Z
- Alphabetical Z to A

### Sticky posts

This option allows you to choose between three options:

- Include (default) â Displays sticky posts.
- Exclude â Removes sticky posts.
- Only â Shows only sticky posts.

### Filters

This option allows you to customize further what posts are being displayed. If you donât see this section, itâs because you need to toggle off the âInherit query from templateâ setting.

![Filtering query loop block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/query-loop-filters.gif)- **Categories â** List any categories you want included.
- **Tags â** List any tags you want included.
- **Authors â** Search for an author and add it to the list, multiple authors are allowed.
- **Keyword â** Enter any keywords you want included.

Mind that custom taxonomies filtering is also possible. Check the following example for the WooCommerce product categories filter:

If you choose a hierarchical post type like Page, these options will be shown:

- **Authors â** Search for an author and add it to the list, multiple authors are allowed.
- **Keyword â** Enter any keywords you want included.
- **Parents** **â** List any parents you want included.

## Advanced Settings

The advanced tab lets you add a CSS class to your block, allowing you to write custom CSS and style the block as you see fit. It also allows you to assign an HTML element.

List View is a new tool to help you navigate between layers of content and nested blocks. Itâs currently visible in the Top Toolbar and will remain open as you navigate through your content. This makes it easy to move between the exact pieces of content you want to alter, whether thatâs an individual Paragraph block at the very end of a post or a Columns block that contains a beautiful selection of products to choose from. Think of it as the ultimate tool to navigate block complexity, select exactly what you need, and easily view all of the blocks that make up your content at once.

## How to use List View

### How to find List View

You can find List View in the top toolbar of the editor:

![The list view button on the editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/Screen-Shot-on-2023-06-14-at-105448.png)### How to open and close List View

To open list view, select the Document Overview icon as shown above. This will cause the view to open and stay open until you close it once more. You can close List View by either selecting the âxâ or by selecting the Document Overview icon once more.

![Screencast displaying how to open and close the list view](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/list-view-open-close.gif)Since WordPress 6.4 version, list view will show image previews for [Image](#documentation/article/image-block) and [Gallery](#documentation/article/gallery-block) blocks.

![List view displaying image previews for Image and Gallery blocks.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/list-view-media-preview-575x1024.png)List view displaying image previews for Image and Gallery blocks.### How to select blocks

List View allows you to both see all of your content at once and select any block youâd like. To select a block and bring it into focus, click on the name of the block in List View. This will select that layer of content for you to then customize to your liking.

### How to select multiple blocks

You can select multiple blocks at one in the List View by holding down the âshiftâ key and clicking on them.

![Screencast of the list view displaying how to select multiple blocks.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/list-view-select-multiple-blocks.gif)### How to drag and drop blocks

After opening List View, select the block or section of blocks you want to drag and drop. After selecting, you can then drag and drop the content wherever youâd like within the List View sidebar. You are not able to drag and drop within the Editor itself.

![Selecting multiple blocks on the list view](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/list-view-move-blocks.gif)### How to make changes to individual blocks

Each block within List View has a three dot menu that you can click on to take further action on the block itself. You can also select a block and delete it with ease using your keyboard controls.

![Opening the menu list for any block on the list view](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/04/image.png)### How to collapse sections

Next to each section of blocks, youâll see an arrow icon that you can click to collapse or expand sections of blocks. This is helpful if youâre trying to navigate between complex content in order to more readily focus on different sections.

![The arrow icon next to each block to collapse or expand block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-3.45.27-PM.png)### How to help distinguish between blocks

If a block has an ID/anchor set, itâs displayed in List View so itâs easier to distinguish between other blocks and reference as you want. Hereâs an example with a `IDname` anchor:

![The ID or anchor set for a block on the list view](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/list-view-block-id-html-anchor-1024x804.png)### Locked Blocks

If a block has been [locked](#documentation/article/more-options), a small icon will show next to its name in the list view.

![Screenshot of the list view with a locked quote block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/list-view-locked-block-1024x846.png)## Template Parts &amp; Synced Patterns

[Template parts](#documentation/article/template-part-block) and [synced patterns](#documentation/article/reusable-blocks) are highlighted in purple to distinguish them from regular blocks. This highlight/outline is visible in the editor area and in the list view itself.

![Screenshot of the list view with template parts and reusable blocks being highlighted in purple.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/list-view-template-parts-reusable-blocks-1024x787.png)## Outline Section

There is an alternative next to the List View called âOutlineâ. The outline displays the follow post information:

- Number of characters.
- Number of words.
- Time to read.
- Heading structure.

# Preferences overview <a name="documentation/article/preferences-overview" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preferences-overview/

When you start using the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) or the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor) and you find the number of choices and panels overwhelming, you can use the Preferences feature to turn on/off the various options, to your liking. This helps to remove the distracting elements in the layout that get in the way of your writing and create an editing experience that you prefer.

## How to find Preferences 

In the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) or the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor), select the three vertical dots icon in the upper-right corner of the top toolbar. This opens up a drop-down menu. Select **Preferences** to open the **Preferences** dialog.

![Image showing the three dot menu > Preferences](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/Preferences.png)## Preferences in the WordPress Block Editor

This section covers preference settings when you are in the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor).

### General

![General tab in Preferences in WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/preference-general-options-modal-WP-62.png)**Publishing:** This lets you customize the options related to publishing a post or page.

- **Include pre-publish checklist**: By toggling this on, you are enabling an extra step to appear before publishing a post/page. You will be asked to review the settings for **Visibility** and **Publish date** and add settings such as **Categories** and **Tags**. This checklist will only appear after you click **Publish**. You can make the relevant changes and click **Publish** one more time to Publish the post/page.

![Pre publish checklist enabled](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-12.36.27-PM.png)**Appearance**: This section covers preferences that are specifically related to how the editor looks and feels.

- **Distraction free**: When you toggle this on, it creates a clean interface with fewer distractions while youâre writing. WordPress turns off various options and panels in the toolbar and removes breadcrumbs at the bottom of the editor. **Keep in mind that these options donât go away!** They are simply hidden while youâre writing.  
    Hovering over or moving focus to the top part of the editor reveals a limited toolbar with selection tools, undo and redo, save, publish, and the button with the tree dots, which opens the options menu.

![New Post Created ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/Add-Post-1.png)- **Spotlight mode**: When you toggle this on, WordPress Block Editor is set to Spotlight mode. All blocks are greyed out except for the one youâre working on so that you can focus on a single block at a time.

![Spotlight mode](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-12-at-10.01.48-PM-1-1024x722.png)Spotlight mode- **Show button text labels**: When you toggle this option, it allows you to show text instead of icons in the Toolbar. This applies to both the Top Toolbar in the Block Editor and the individual Block Toolbar.

![Top Toolbar when the option is turned off](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/Top-Toolbar-off.png)**Top Toolbar** when the option is turned off![Top Toolbar when the option is turned on](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/button-text-top-toolbar-WP-62-1024x57.png)**Top Toolbar** when the option is turned on- **Always open list view:** When you toggle this on, the list view sidebar is open by default every time you open the Block Editor.

![Always show list view](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/Always-show-list-view-1024x196.png)- **Use theme styles**: This option is what allows your editor to look like your theme so that, as youâre creating content, you have a strong sense of what it will look like upon publishing. If youâd rather focus on the content itself and not necessarily on how it will look, you can toggle this option off to have your theme styles removed.

- **Display block breadcrumbs**: When you toggle this one, WordPress Block Editor shows block breadcrumbs at the bottom of the editor. Block breadcrumbs allow you to easily get a sense of where you are in the content and offer a way to easily select parent blocks. This is particularly helpful when youâre dealing with layers of nested blocks or more complicated arrangements.

![Display block breadcrumbs](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-2.09.44-PM-941x1024.png)### Blocks

![Blocks tab in the Preferences in WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.27.20-PM.png)**Block interactions**: This section helps to customize how you interact with blocks in the block inserter

- **Show most used blocks**: When you toggle this option on, it enables a section in the Block Inserter that shows all the blocks that you use the most. This can be helpful to easily find the blocks that you use frequently to build your page or post content.

![Most Used blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.16.55-PM.png)- **Contain text cursor inside block**: This option aids screen readers by stopping the text caret from leaving blocks.

**Visible blocks**: This section lets you disable blocks that you donât want to appear in the inserter. They can always be toggled back on later.

![Blocks tab & reset Button in the Preferences in WordPress Block Editor ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/10/Blocks_VisibleBlock.png)1. You can search for blocks easily by typing in the name in the search box.
2. You can check or uncheck the boxes to show or hide the blocks from the list.
3. As you uncheck the blocks from the list, you will get a message at the top showing how many blocks have been hidden. If you want to undo these changes, just click the â**Reset**â button.

### Panels

![Panels tab in the Preferences in WordPress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.27.29-PM.png)**Document settings**: This section lets you choose what panels appear in the [Page/Post Settings Sidebar](#documentation/article/settings-sidebar). If you toggle an item off here, it will hide that section in the [page/post settings sidebar](#documentation/article/settings-sidebar). If you find that you donât use a specific panel in the settings sidebar and want to simplify your editing experience, this option is helpful.

**Additional**: This section lets you add extra areas to the editor.

![Enable Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-25-at-4.31.30-PM.png)Enable Custom FieldsCurrently, you have the option to toggle on Custom Fields. Once you toggle on, click **Enable &amp; Reload** for the changes to take effect. Keep in mind that this will reload the post/page for the change to take effect and itâs important to save your content first before changing this setting.

## Preferences in the Site Editor

This section covers preference settings when you are in the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor). There are fewer settings in the Site Editor but the options work similarly to the ones in the WordPress Block Editor Preferences.

# Block themes <a name="documentation/article/block-themes" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/

As of WordPress 5.9, block themes are now a part of the WordPress ecosystem as a new type of theme built with and for blocks.

## What is a block theme?

A block theme is a theme that uses blocks for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer. These themes are built for the newest features coming to WordPress that allow you to edit and customize all parts of your site. This allows you to switch up key parts of your theme without ever needing to change themes.

With a block theme, you can place and edit blocks outside your content using the [Template Editor](#documentation/article/template-editor) or [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor). You can use blocks in templates provided by a theme or plugin. For example, an archive page or a 404 page. You can also create custom templates.

For general information about themes, see the support article [What is a theme?](#documentation/article/using-themes)

**How do this impact widgets and widget areas?**

Instead of widgets, a block theme relies on blocks. This means that you can place blocks anywhere you might have previously wanted widgets to appear.

**How does this impact the Customizer?**

The [Customizer](#documentation/article/appearance-customize-screen) is not available in block themes unless you are using a plugin or theme that requires it to be activated. This is because you can make the same changes you might make with the Customizer with blocks. For example, there are now blocks for the site title, tagline, and site logo. You can also select colors for your website in the [Styles](#documentation/article/styles-overview) setting by going to **Administration Screen** &gt; **Appearance** &gt; **Editor (beta).**

## How to find block themes

You can find block themes in the [WordPress theme directory](#themes/tags/full-site-editing) by selecting **Block Themes** in the toolbar. This automatically takes you to a filtered view of all themes with Full Site Editing functionality.

![Visual of the theme directory with an emphasis on the block themes tab. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/07/Screen-Shot-2022-07-14-at-9.17.12-PM-1-1024x159.png)Themes Directory â Block ThemesFor general information about how to get new themes, see the support article [Get new themes](#documentation/article/using-themes).

## What options are available with block themes?

After activating a block theme, more tools and features will be available to you including the following:

- [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor): an editor that allows you to edit all parts of your site, navigate between templates, and more.
- [Styles](#documentation/article/styles-overview): a feature that allows you to customize your site, including individual blocks, as much as youâd like with different colors, typography, layouts, and more.
- [Templates](#documentation/article/template-editor): edit, create, and manage templates that a page or post uses.
- [Template parts](#documentation/article/template-part-block): a way to organize and display groups of blocks as part of a block template mainly for site structure, like Headers and Footers.
- Theme blocks including the [Navigation Block](#documentation/article/navigation-block), [Query Loop block](#documentation/article/query-loop-block), and more.

Using these options you can create the desired look and feel of your site without switching themes as often.

## When should I use a block theme?

Block themes were introduced in WordPress since the 5.9 release. If you like exploring new things, enjoy building content with the [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) and like to have full control over all parts of your site, block themes are a great solution for you.

If youâre comfortable doing so, it might help to [set up a test site](#documentation/article/test-driving-wordpress) to try out a block theme first to see if it will work for you.

## How are block themes different from classic themes?

Block themes are built for the newer functionality in WordPress and allow you to use blocks to edit all parts of your site, including easier ways to quickly customize everything from your background colors to font sizes for all Heading blocks etc. Comparatively, classic themes are built with PHP templates, functions.php and more that include features like Widgets, a dedicated Menus section, the Customizer, and more. Classic themes do not work with the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor).

# Template Part block <a name="documentation/article/template-part-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/template-part-block/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Template Part block* is an advanced block introduced in WordPress 5.9 that can be used with a block theme or a theme that supports [template editing](#themes/tags/template-editing). They often come with your theme and are used to organize and display your site structure. You can only use them while creating and editing templates to manage blocks in areas repeated across the website. For context, this block is best used to create areas like your site header and site footer. When you change blocks inside a template part, the editor updates the blocks on every block template that includes the template part.

In order to add a *Template Part block*, click on the add block button and select the *Template Part block*. You can also type *â/template partâ* and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly. In many cases, youâll also see options to select types of Template Part blocks, like Header and Footer when searching for this block. You can search for the header or footer in the block inserter to insert the blocks or use the shortcuts *â/headerâ* and *â/footerâ.*

*Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found [here](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).*

## Adding template parts

You can add templates when using the [Template Editor](#documentation/article/template-editor) or [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor) to edit templates directly. After adding a template part, you can choose from existing parts or create a new template part:

![Template part block provides two buttons: "choose" and "start blank". ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/adding-template-part-block.png)### Choosing from existing template parts

Selecting the button âChooseâ opens a modal where you can search, preview, and select existing parts. These parts will depend on what your theme has provided:

![Using the "choose button", existing template parts can be selected. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/choosing-template-part-1024x752.png)### Creating new template parts

Selecting âStart blankâ will prompt you to add a name. Itâs best to pick a descriptive name so that itâs easy to find in the future:

![When we create a new template part block, we get a field to edit the name and options to create or cancel. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-12.12.43-PM.png)Click on the âstart blankâ button to place the block and begin customizing. ### Creating new template parts from the template part list

If you are using a block theme, you can also create a new template part from the template part list in Administration Screen &gt; Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Patterns &gt; Template Parts. Click on the Create patterns icon to find Create template part:

![Template part list area also provides an option to create template part. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/creating-new-template-part-770x1024.png)Creating template part from Patterns areaWhen you select the Create template part, a modal appears where you can add a name and select the area for the template part. You must provide a name in order to create a new template part:

![Upon clicking on create template part, a pop up appears with the title "Create a template part".](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-12.19.00-PM-982x1024.png)### Importing widget area

If youâve switched from a classic theme to a block theme and widgets created in the classic theme, you can import them from Import Widget Area dropdown in the Advanced Settings. Select the widget from dropdown and click Import.

![Import Widget Area menu in the sidebar.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/02/importing-widget-area_6.4-1024x588.jpg)Screenshot### Managing template parts and patterns

At the bottom of the patterns screen, there is an option to manage all template parts. From you can create new template parts, or rename, delete and reset customizations made to the template parts.

![At the bottom of template part list, there is a link named "manage all template parts" which opens this list of template parts.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/managing-template-parts-1024x355.png)## Customizing template parts

After adding or selecting a *Template Part block*, you can customize in various ways by adding additional blocks within it. To make it easier to find current template parts to edit, itâs recommended that you use one of the following options:

- Use [List View](#documentation/article/list-view) when youâre editing a template to quickly identify the Headers and Footers in your content to edit.
- Use the template part focus mode described below.

### Template part focus mode

To make it easier to focus specifically on editing a single template part, like a Header or Footer, you can use a dedicated mode that only shows an individual template part. To access this mode, Select the template part and click Edit from the toolbar.

### Replacing one template part with another

If the theme has more than one patterns for the same template part area, you will see a pattern selector in the template inspector panel. If you donât see this selector, this is because the theme hasnât provided multiple patterns for the same area.

## Advanced Settings

Under Advanced settings, you can rename the template part and select an area: General, header, or footer. The panel also lets you change the HTML element and add CSS class(es) to your block. You can choose between these HTML elements: Div, header, footer, main, section, article, and aside.

# Styles overview <a name="documentation/article/styles-overview" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/styles-overview/

Styles is a new feature that allows you to set the overall aesthetics and layout of your site at a global level, instead of editing individual blocks or pages. It is included in [block themes](#documentation/article/block-themes) and requires WordPress 5.9 or higher.

You can set the colors, typography, layout, spacing, and more, for the entire site and give your website a cohesive look that shows off your brand.

You can also edit the default appearance of blocks to streamline the look and feel of your website â add your unique colors to create a branded Button block, or adjust the Heading block to your preferred font size.

## How styles work

The styles you set from within the **Styles** interface impact your entire site. For eg: if you change the background color here, it changes the background color of all your posts, pages, and templates.

In the **Styles** panel, you will find the styles and default settings provided by your theme and the ones that come with WordPress.

You can override these settings with your own choices from the **Styles** panel. For eg: you can add your own custom colors to the color palette, change the layout dimensions, and more.

![Image showing the Styles sidebar open with all options listed.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-13-at-8.57.28-AM-131x300.png)Styles sidebarYou can also customize the appearance of specific blocks for the entire site. For eg: you can choose a background color and set the font size and line height for all the Quote blocks on your site.

## How to use the styles panel

To access this feature, you will need to install and activate a [block theme](#themes/tags/full-site-editing) and be using WordPress 5.9 or higher.

Go to **Appearance** &gt; **Editor**. Select the half-shaded circle icon at the top right-hand corner of the screen, above the block settings sidebar, to access the **Styles** panel. The **Styles** icon is available in the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor), and when editing the [template](#documentation/article/template-editor) or [template parts](#documentation/article/template-part-block).

In the **Styles** panel, you will see sections for **Typography**, **Colors,** and **Layout**. Any changes made from here will affect the entire site.

You will also find a section for **Blocks**. Clicking on the **Blocks** section will show you a list of all the blocks. You can select any block type and customize the appearance of that particular block, across the whole site.

### The styles welcome guide

When you open the **Styles** panel for the first time, you will be taken to a **Welcome Guide** dialog. You can click through the guide using the **Next** and **Previous** links at the bottom or close the dialog by clicking the **X** icon at the top right corner of the dialog.

![Welcome guide in the Styles interface](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-13-at-10.12.27-AM-1024x468.png)Welcome guideIf you want to access the **Welcome Guide** in the future, you can find it by clicking on the three vertical dots icon in the upper right-hand corner and selecting **Welcome Guide**.

![A red arrow pointing to the three dot menu where, when clicked, the Welcome Guide can be opened. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-3.49.28-PM.png)### Style variations

![How to use the style variations](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-13-at-12.04.54-PM.png)Style variations are a new feature of [block themes](#documentation/article/block-themes) that were introduced in WordPress 6.0.

With these style variations, you are presented with alternate versions of your [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) with different combinations of colors, fonts, typography, spacing, block settings, and more. You can easily swap the style variations and change the look and feel of your site without changing your theme.

1. In the **Styles** panel, you can find a screenshot of the Style variation that your site is currently using.
2. Select **Browse styles** at the bottom of the screenshot to explore the different style variations available with your [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes). From the available choices, you can pick a different style combination and instantly see how your site looks with this style variation, in the Editor.
3. Click the left arrow icon to go back to the **Styles** panel.

Video showing how to use the style variations### Color and typography style variations

Color and typography variations are subsets of the existing global style variations system that were introduced in WordPress 6.6. Color and typography variations are limited in scope toâas their names implyâcolors and typography.

When they are available, these variations appear as new options in the Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Styles sidebar panel and elsewhere:

![Setting the content widths in Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-11.16.11-AM-2.png)This section allows you to set the width of the main content area of your website globally.

You can set the **content** width and **wide** width in PX, %, EM, REM, VW and VH units. The content width set here will be the default width of the blocks when they set **Align** to **None** in the Block Toolbar. The wide width set here will be the width of the blocks when they set **Align** to **Wide width** in the Block Toolbar.

To reset the values for **Content** and **Wide**, click the three vertical dots icon and select **Content size** or **Wide size** and the changes you made are reverted.

![Reverting the Content and Wide size](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-3.11.04-PM-2.png)You can also set the **Padding** or the blank space around your website from the **Layout** panel.

- You can set the padding on the four sides: top, right, bottom, and left.
- By default, **Padding** is locked which means that when you adjust the padding value it applies to all four sides. If you click the link icon, it unlinks the sides and you can set the **Padding** on each side individually.

![Padding linked in the Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-12.18.12-PM-1-1.png)Padding linked![Padding unlinked in the Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-12.18.25-PM-518x1024.png)Padding unlinked- **Padding** can be set in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, and VH units.
- You can add values to the text box or use the slider to adjust the values for **Padding**.

Built into the Styles experience are preset spacing values for padding. Your theme author can set baseline values for spacing and when you use the Stylesâ padding preset slider, you can create consistent spacing across the elements within the site.

- Clicking the black slider icon in the right corner (next to the link icon) will show the padding space preset slider.

![Use the padding preset](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-15-at-2.53.07-PM-2.png)- To reset the values for **Padding**, click the three vertical dots icon and select **Padding** and the changes you made are reverted.

Video showing how to set Padding in StylesIn the Layout panel, you can also set the **Block spacing** which is the vertical spacing between the blocks.

- ****Block spacing**** can be set in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, and VH units.
- You can add values to the text box or use the slider to adjust the values for ****Block spacing****.

Similar to padding, WordPress comes with preset spacing guidelines that your theme author can set baseline values for and when you use the Stylesâ block spacing preset slider, you can create consistent block spacing between the blocks.

- Clicking the black slider icon in the right corner (next to the link icon) will show the block spacing preset slider.
- To reset the values for ******Block spacing******, click the three vertical dots icon and select ******Block spacing,****** and the changes you made are reverted.

Video showing how to use block spacing in Styles### Blocks

In the **Blocks** panel, you will see a list of all the blocks that can be customized for the whole site. You can also search for a block by its name in the search box. Click on a block from the list to see the available options for that block.

The changes you make to the blocksâ appearances in the Styles panel affect every block of that type on your site unless they are customized individually on your post or page. For example, if you set a custom color for a Button block on your Home page, the color set in the Styles panel for the Button block will be overwritten by the color you choose on the Home page.

As you make changes, as of WordPress 6.2, you will see a live preview of the impact of those changes youâre making as shown below:

Each block has its own set of options to customize. For example, you can customize the border, radius, duotone, etc. for the [Image block](#documentation/article/image-block) or change the paddings, margins, colors, and fonts for the [Heading block](#documentation/article/heading-block).

#### Margin settings for blocks

**Padding** is the space between a blockâs content and its border whereas **Margin** is the space outside the border of a block.

The following blocks have a **Margin** control for **Top**, **Right**, **Bottom,** and **Left**, in the **Blocks** section under **Layouts**.

By default, **Margin** is locked which means that when you adjust the margin value it applies to all sides. If you click the link icon, it unlinks the sides and you can set the **Margin** on each side individually.

![Margin linked in the Blocks Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-12.44.51-PM-1.png)![Margin unlinked in the Blocks Layout Panel](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-12.45.03-PM-521x1024.png)Your theme author can set baseline values for spacing and when you use the Stylesâ margin preset slider, you can create consistent spacing across the elements within the site.

Clicking the slider icon in the right corner (next to the link icon) will switch the **Margin** controls from the preset slider to the text box view. You can add values to the text box or use the slider to adjust the values for **Margin**. **Margin** can be set in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, and VH units.

![Use custom size for margin](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-12.56.47-PM-2.png)To reset the values for **Margin**, click the three vertical dots icon and select **Margin,** and the changes you made are reverted.

Using the **Border** controls, you can set the border around a block. You can choose the border color from the color picker. You can set the border width in PX, %, EM, REM, VW or VH, by entering the width in the text box or the slider to adjust the values.

![Border color and width using the slider and text box.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-5.24.47-PM-1024x631.png)By default, border width is locked which means that when you adjust the value it applies to all sides. If you click the link icon, it unlinks the sides and you can set the Border on each side individually.

![Border width unlinked.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-16-at-5.23.46-PM-1.png)Using the **Radius** controls, you can round the corners of a blockâs outer border. You can also set the border Radius in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, or VH, by entering the value in the text box or by adjusting the slider.

By default, border radius is locked which means that when you adjust the value it applies to all four corners. If you click the link icon, it unlinks the corners and you can set the radius on each corner individually â Top left, Top right, Bottom left, and Bottom right.

![Border Radius and Border width controls](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/image-1.png)Video showing how to set the Border and Radius#### Horizontal block spacing settings for blocks

The following blocks have **Horizontal Block spacing** control in the **Blocks** section under **Layouts**.

- Columns
- Social Icons

By default, the **Block Spacing** control is locked which means that when you adjust the value it applies to both the horizontal and vertical. If you click the link icon, it unlinks and you can set the **Block Spacing** for vertical and horizontal separately.

Video showing how to set the horizontal spacing#### Editing block variations

Some blocks come built in with variations, different options of the same block. When thatâs the case, as of WordPress 6.2, you will see the option

#### Adding box shadows to button block

With WordPress 6.2, there are four shadow presets you can choose from by default. The following come by default for you to use:

- Natural
- Crisp
- Sharp
- Soft

![adding box shadows](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/215996506-18110458-e933-4c9b-a94e-5f5974b31cd7-1024x425.png)## Styling the site tagline

The Global Styles section lets the users set and unset the Site Tagline. Users can also update the font and color of the site tagline through this section. This is an optional setting which the users can utilize if they as per their needs.

![how to style the site tagline](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/03/220521940-b6df89c3-63ed-4ff1-b3c0-e66ac6009c1a-1024x704.png)## Preview your changes with style book

When making changes to the styles of your site, whether changing to a different style variation or tweaking an individual block, itâs imperative to see the cascading impact. With the addition of the style book in WordPress 6.2, a view that you can toggle on and off as you would like, you can see all of your blocks on your site as you make changes:

## Applying Custom CSS

The Site Editor seeks to enable customization at every level across your site. In some cases, as features are being built, there are gaps in whatâs possible. As a result, itâs recommended to start first from the options available within Styles before adding custom CSS. For any current gaps, you can add Custom CSS. Note that any CSS changes you make *wonât* be overwritten by a theme update, but they *will* be cleared when you switch themes.

### Site-wide Custom CSS

A site-wide custom CSS editor is built into the Styles interface, as of WordPress 6.2. Click the three dot menu and select âAdditional CSS.â Any CSS added here is applied across the entire site.

![Additional CSS option visible from the three dot menu in the Style interface with a red arrow pointing to it to highlight the location. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-4.15.11-PM.png)![Screenshot of Additional CSS panel with an example of CSS to change the colour of the Post Excerpt's Continue Reading Link](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/global-css-editor.png)Once any global Custom CSS is saved, an Additional CSS field is displayed in the top-level Styles interface.

![Additional CSS option visible from the main Style interface with a red arrow pointing to it to highlight the location. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-4.17.32-PM-432x1024.png)### Per-block CSS

As you navigate to each individual block under Styles &gt; Blocks, youâll find an âAdditional block CSSâ section. When you add CSS here, it applies only to that specific block type, throughout the entire site.

![Additional block CSS option visible from within the Styles interface for an individual block with a red arrow pointing to it to highlight the location. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-27-at-4.23.19-PM-460x1024.png)Because CSS added here is for a specific block type, you should not add a selector or curly braces. Follow the `property: value` format.

For example, if you wanted to display the quotation portion of the Quote block in italics, you could add this in the Quote blockâs CSS editor:

```
font-style: italic;
```

Hereâs how that looks in the editor:

![Editor screenshot showing Quote block with italicized text and the CSS in the block's Additional CSS editor which reads: font-style: italic;](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/quote-block-css.png)And this is how the CSS is output on the front end:

```
.wp-block-quote {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

Notice how WordPress automatically adds the `property: value` pair to the blockâs selector.

By using CSS combinators like spaces and `<` or pseudo-classes and -elements, you can create more complex effects, including hover states. You can also use the ampersand (`&`) as in SASS/LESS, to target a nested element.

For example, hereâs some CSS you could add in the Button blockâs CSS editor to create a hover state for the Button block:

```
:hover {
  background: #bb00bb;
}
```

Note that in this case, you *do* need to include curly braces in the code. The resulting CSS on the front end is:

  background: #bb00bb;
}
```

# Navigation block <a name="documentation/article/navigation-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/navigation-block/

The *Navigation Block* is an advanced block in WordPress 5.9 that enables you to edit your siteâs navigation menu, both in terms of structure and design. The *Navigation block* can be used with a [block theme](#themes/tags/full-site-editing) or a theme that has support for [template editing](#themes/tags/template-editing).

In order to add a *Navigation block*, click on the add block button and select the *Navigation block*. You can also type â/navigationâ and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly.

[Detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block)

The *Navigation Block* has a dedicated list view tab in the settings panel where you can configure and customize the navigation.

## Block Configuration

When you add a *Navigation* *block* for the first time and donât have any existing menu, it will start with a *Page List block*.

To start editing the menu, open the **Settings** panel, and select **Page List** from the list view. Click **Edit**, and the page list items will transform into *Page Link* blocks.

![The navigation block with the "Page List" visible and the "Edit" button highlighted.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/navigation-block-page-list.png)### Creating a new menu

You can create a new menu from scratch via the *Navigation block*âs list view in the settings panel. Click the **Menu** options button and select **Create a new menu**.

![Creating a new menu.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/navigation-block-create-menu.gif)The next step is to add individual blocks to your navigation. You can do so from the editor canvas or the list view in the settings panel.

Click the **Delete menu** button, and a prompt will appear to confirm your action.

Once youâve clicked **Confirm**, the menu will be deleted, and the navigation block will be replaced with a placeholder. You can then start creating a new menu or selecting an existing one from the settings panel.

Currently, this section consists of one setting that allows you to control what is shown for the *Navigation block* across different screen sizes, allowing for a responsive menu option:

- **Mobile:** This enables a menu icon to be displayed when viewing your site on smaller screens that one can click on to see the entire menu.
- **Always:** This enables the menu icon to be displayed regardless of screen size.

By default, this option is set to **Mobile**, which will automatically show a menu icon on smaller screen sizes. When you click on the menu icon, it will open up an overlay that shows your entire menu.

![Display options on the Navigation block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/navigation-block-mobile.png)There are two additional settings specifically for submenus:

- **Open on click:** By default, submenus will open on hover. You can activate this option if you prefer them to open by clicking on them.

Layout settings allow you to change the justification and orientation of child blocks nested inside their parent blocks, with layout controls found on the parent blocks.

[This article provides details about layout settings.](#documentation/article/layout-settings-overview)

### Color

# Site Editor <a name="documentation/article/site-editor" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/

The Site editor allows you to design the entire site including the header, footer, and everything in between, with [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks). It gives you greater control over how your site looks.

The Site Editor is **only** available when you install and activate a [Block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) on your site.

## How to access the Site editor

To work with the Site editor, you need to use a [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) on your site. A block theme is a theme that uses [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer.

All [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) that are available in the [WordPress Block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) can be used in the Site editor. A set of blocks called [Theme blocks](#documentation/article/blocks#theme-blocks) are specifically built for the Site editor.

To find block themes, from the WordPress dashboard, go to **Appearance** &gt; **Themes** and click **Add New**. In the **Add Themes** page, select **Block Themes** to find the growing list of [Block themes](#documentation/article/block-themes) in the [WordPress theme directory](#themes/tags/full-site-editing).

![Appearance > Themes showing block theme options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/01/Appearance-Themes-showing-block-themes-1024x517.png)How to find a block themeOnce you install and activate a Block theme on your site, go to **Appearance** &gt; **Editor** to open the Site Editor.

## Useful tools when using the Site Editor

The following tools are helpful when using the Site Editor.

### The Command Palette

The Command Palette offers you a quick way to navigate the **content** of your site and to invoke different **actions** such as creating new posts/pages, toggling preferences, and accessing your styles and custom CSS settings.

You can open the Command Palette in the Site View in the sidebar by clicking on the **search icon** and. In Edit View, the Command Palette is in the **top Title Bar**. You can also use the **keyboard shortcut** `Cmd+k` on Mac or `Ctrl+k` on Windows

### List View

List View helps you navigate complex block layouts and nested block structures. You can select exactly which block you need, and get a quick overview of the block layout on the page you are working on. You can easily select multiple blocks and edit, move or group them.

Learn more about List View in this support article: [List View](#documentation/article/list-view).

### Block Patterns

Block Patterns are a collection of predefined blocks that you can insert into posts and pages. You can then customize them further. WordPress comes with a set of standard Block Patterns. You can also find Block Patterns bundled with the [block themes](#documentation/article/block-themes).

### Copy and paste styles

With WordPress 6.2, a new option was added to allow you to copy and paste block styles, making it easy to reuse designs youâve created. You can find this from the three dot menu in any block and itâs meant to be used to copy and paste between the same type of block:

### Apply style changes globally

If youâre more comfortable with more advanced options when creating a design or customizing individual blocks, as of WordPress 6.2, you can take changes made to an individual block and apply it to **all blocks of the same type**. For example, you could apply a single design for an individual block to all blocks in your site with a new option under the **Advanced** section of block settings.

![How to apply the current's block style to all styles of that same type across your site by clicking on Block Settings > Advanced > Apply Globally](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/site-editor-apply-styles-globally-1024x593.png)### Resize the preview of the Site Editor

When youâre in the Site Editor, you might want to change the preview of the template or template part youâre viewing. You can do this by selecting the handles of the dark gray sidebar and moving it to your liking.

# Dimension Settings overview <a name="documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview/

You can use the dimension settings in [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) to help you better customize your layout and design. These settings impact the dimensions of blocks in various ways, including how groups of blocks are placed alongside one another.

The dimension settings are available when you use the [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor). If you are new to the block editor, [this guide](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks) will show you how to work with blocks. You can read more about the new block editor features and improvements [in this article.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/26/core-editor-improvement-catalyst-for-creativity/)

## How to access dimension settings

The dimension settings can be found in the Block Settings sidebar of a [block](#documentation/article/blocks) under the section **Dimension**.

If you donât see the **Block Settings** sidebar, select the block you want to customize, then click the **settings** icon (a cog) that is to the right of the **Publish** or **Update** buttons in the WordPress Editor.

Below are a few examples from different blocks:

![Button Block sidebar & settings, with the dimensions section highlighted. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-5.png)![Paragraph Block sidebar & settings, with the dimensions section highlighted. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-6.png)![Cover Block sidebar & settings, with the dimensions section highlighted. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-7.png)Each block has different dimensions settings In the **Dimension** section, click on the three-dot menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the dimension settings that are not visible by default.

Note that the type of dimension settings you can see in your block depends on whether they have been supported by the block or not.

If you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking **Reset All** as [shown in this article](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks#reset-controls). This resets the settings and removes all of your changes. You can reset individual settings by clicking **Reset** on each setting. You can also reset all of them globally by clicking on the **Reset All** option.

![Image of the reset and reset all options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-8.png)## Type of settings

Each block comes with different dimension settings.

### Padding

This setting impacts the space between a blockâs content and its border. You can either set horizontal and vertical paddings or set different padding values for each side. To set different padding for each side, follow the steps in the **[Unlink sides](#unlink-sides)** section.

![Image of the padding dimension settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-9.png)### Margin

This setting impacts the space around a block. You can either set horizontal and vertical margins or set different margin values for each side. To set different margins for each side, follow the steps in the **[Unlink sides](#unlink-sides)** section.

![Image of the padding dimension settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-10.png)**Preview margin and padding**

When changing the margin or padding in a block, the editor will show the corresponding change, highlighted in a blue box around the block.

### Block spacing

This setting impacts the space between nested blocks. This means that if you set block spacing for the entire block, you can change the spacing of the nested block within the parent block. You can find this setting in blocks like the [Buttons block](#documentation/article/buttons-block) or [Group block](#documentation/article/group-block).

Within this setting, you can choose to set block spacing using different values:[ px, %, em, rem, vw, vh](#documentation/article/typography-settings-overview).

![Image showing the various block spacing options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/dimensions-block-spacing.png)### Minimum height

This setting enables you to set a minimum height for the block. You can find this option in the [Cover block](#documentation/article/cover-block), [Post Content block](#documentation/article/post-content-block), [Group block](#documentation/article/group-block) (including the [Row](#documentation/article/row-block) and [Stack](#documentation/article/stack-block) variations). Within this setting, you can choose to set the height using different values: [px, %, em, rem, vw, vh](#documentation/article/typography-settings-overview).

An example use case is to ensure that a Post Content area has a minimum height, forcing a footer area to render lower on the page, even if a page has very little content. Because of this, it can be quite useful to use viewport relative units when setting minimum height, e.g. `100vh` for a block that takes up the entire height of the viewport.

![Image showing the various minimum height options.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/dimensions-minimum-height-1.png)## Unlink sides

By default, the Padding and Margin settings will apply the same value for vertical and horizontal settings around the block. You can add a different value to each of the sides by clicking on the **padding options** or **margin options** icon on the right.

A drop-down menu will appear where you can select any of the side to modify. You can select a specific side (**Top**, **Right**, **Bottom**, and **Left**) to have a specific setting for the side, or select **Custom** to make individual setting for each side.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-12.png)![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-13.png)![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/2023-08-24_10-46.png)![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/2023-08-24_10-47.png)To return to adding the same value for all sides, just select the same icon again.

## Set custom size &amp; change units

You can add custom values for a blockâs margin, padding, or spacing, and also change the units to one of the following: [px, %, em, rem, vw, vh.](#documentation/article/typography-settings-overview)

# Comparing Patterns, Template Parts, and Synced Patterns (Reusable Blocks) <a name="documentation/article/comparing-patterns-template-parts-and-reusable-blocks" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comparing-patterns-template-parts-and-reusable-blocks/

## Overview

With more types of reusable content you can create with WordPress, this article seeks to clarify when it makes sense to use certain types in different situations to help guide you to make the best decisions possible. At a high level, this will focus on Template Part blocks, Block Patterns, and Synced Patterns (Reusable Blocks).

WordPress 6.3 renamed Reusable Blocks to Patterns. A synced pattern will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block.

### Template Part

The Template Part block is an advanced block that can be used with a block theme or a theme that supports [template editing](#themes/tags/template-editing). They often come with your theme and are used to organize and display your site structure. For more information, you can learn more in the [Template Part block support article](#documentation/article/template-part-block).

### Synced pattern (Reusable block)

Synced pattern is a kind of block pattern that enabled Synced option, and it will behave in exactly the same way as a reusable block. Editing the synced pattern will update it anywhere it is used. After creating a synced pattern, you can âDetachâ it to a regular block, and edit the block without affecting your already saved synced pattern. For more information, you can learn more in the [Synced Pattern article](#documentation/article/reusable-blocks).

### Block Patterns

Block Patterns are a collection of predefined blocks that you can insert into posts and pages and then customize with your own content. For more information, you can learn more in the [Block Pattern support article](#documentation/article/block-pattern).

Hereâs a table comparing these different options to each other:

|  | **Template Part** | **Synced Patterns**    **(Reusable Block)** | **Patterns** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Type | Site Structure | User Content | User Content |
| Syncing Ability | Synced | Synced | Un-synced |
| Example | Footer | Business hours | Call to action |

Site structure means it should not be a part of your content, like a post or page. Syncing ability touches on whether if you update it in one spot, it updates everywhere the same block is used.

## Guidelines

Based on the above, this means itâs best to use template parts and Synced pattern for things you want to have in sync with each other whereas patterns are best for content that you expect to change across your site.

In general, template parts should not be added to a Synced pattern or a regular pattern since this is meant to represent site structure rather than content. A template part can include a Synced pattern though or be built using patterns! You can also use block patterns to build templates and template parts, but you should not use a template part inside a pattern.

## Situationals

### Repeated content across your site

This could be everything from how to get in touch to your business hours to your social media accounts. To avoid having to add the same content to a paragraph block every time you want to place it at the end of your post, you can make it a Synced pattern.

### Repeated structure across your site

For anything thatâs more about site structure thatâs repeated across your site, like a Header or Footer, itâs best to use a template part. These carry semantic meaning within block themes so itâs important to make the distinction.

### Repeated design or layout

When itâs less about content and more about wanting to repeat a design or layout, patterns are best to use. This is because the content doesnât need to be synced and, instead, what you want repeated is how something visually looks.

## Changelog

- Updated 2023-08-08 
    - WP 6.3 introduced custom patterns, and Reusable Block was renamed to Synced Pattern.

1. Foreground and background
2. Foreground and secondary
3. Foreground and tertiary
4. Primary and background
5. Primary and secondary
6. Primary and tertiary

These are based on the foreground, background, primary, secondary and tertiary colors set in the themeâs color palette.

# Submit your Block Pattern to the Directory <a name="documentation/article/submit-your-block-pattern-to-the-directory" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/submit-your-block-pattern-to-the-directory/

[Block Patterns](#documentation/article/block-pattern) are a collection of designed core blocks that can be used in posts and pages. They are building blocks to get content created faster. Eg: a subscription form, a Call-to-Action, or a Price List.

[Learn more on how to use Block Patterns](#documentation/article/block-pattern)

The [Block Pattern Directory](#documentation/article/block-pattern-directory) has a myriad of block patterns that work with any site. Themes can reference patterns from the [Directory](#documentation/article/block-directory), without loading them with the theme on every site. This helps to share block patterns from one site to the next.

It is now possible for designers, site builders, and site owners to share their creations with the world and submit their best designs to the [Block Pattern Directory.](#documentation/article/block-pattern-directory) This is a great way where #nocode contributors can share their creations with the WordPress community, in addition to the [WordPress Photo Directory](#photos).

## How to submit a Block Pattern 

Before your start, [check out the guidelines](#patterns/about) for successfully submitting your pattern.

- Keep placeholder content to a minimum, a few lines will be enough to demonstrate most blocks.
- Use a descriptive name for your pattern. Names like âTestâ or âMy Patternâ will be declined.

Here is how to create a new Pattern and submit it to the [Block Pattern Directory](#documentation/article/block-pattern-directory):

1. Create an account on [WordPress.org](https://WordPress.org)
2. After you log in, go to the [Pattern Creator page](#patterns/new-pattern)
3. On the page, you find a stand-alone [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor), where you can create your Block Pattern by adding and arranging the [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks).
4. Give a **Title** for the Block Pattern.

![Add title for the Block Pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-11.48.47-AM.png)5. Now populate the canvas with the available [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks).
6. Use the Block toolbar and block settings sidebar to configure the blocks.
7. Click **Save draft** to save the pattern as a draft. When you are finished click on the **Submit** button.
8. When you click the **Submit** button, you will be prompted to give your pattern a **Title** and a **Description**. Make it distinct and helpful to the reader.
9. Next, you will be asked to select a **Category** for your pattern. Categories help people find patterns and determine where your pattern will appear in the [WordPress Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor). This also corresponds with the categories listed in the [Pattern Directory](#patterns): Buttons, Columns, Footer, Gallery, Header, Images, Query, Text, and Wireframe.

![Categories for the Block Pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-11.59.54-AM-1024x636.png)10. Once you click **Finish**, you will be taken to a **Thank you** dialog. At this stage, your Pattern is pending review. Once your Pattern is approved and published in the [public directory](#documentation/article/block-pattern-directory), you will receive an email.

![Thank you dialog after submitting a Block Pattern](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-28-at-12.03.50-PM-1024x502.png)## How to view your Block Patterns

## About the media library in the Pattern directory

The Media Library for the Pattern Directory is powered by [Openverse](#openverse). You have direct access to the library of images published in the public domain or with the CC0 license, no attribution is needed.

You can search by keyword and then browse through the results to select the image youâd like to add to your block pattern.

![The Openverse Pattern media modal with a variety of images to choose from.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mGdkFRRjJ9jJIbWmPUTV2XSA0dKNQTZwdzHmTQtjeQ6Hh4rmbhzFpzvDgqIuoXIIiiPmnkhq15p18HGS0R7ZxjKzs-BGB5dZ8d3Mf81b9TXBG0boJSKu7Yt4iwQFI3BSa8Ok6f_P)Using the [Openverse](#openverse) library helps in the following ways:

- The user of the Block Pattern can be fairly certain they can use the image on their website.
- The creator of the Block Pattern doesnât have to upload an image to the Block Pattern Directory.
- The image is visible on any site, whether it is locally hosted on someone elseâs computer or on their development site, or in production.

## Restrictions

As with any public directory on WordPress.org, there are a few restrictions when creating Block Patterns

- You can only use Core blocks to create the Block Patterns.
- You can only use the [Openverse](#openverse) media.
- Only core colors and duotone filters presets are available.
- Images need explicit size value/settings .
- Dynamic blocks wonât work (Query Block, Site Title, etc).

Make sure you read the official [Pattern Directory submission guidelines.](#patterns/about)

Changelog:

- Updated 2022-11-28

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

With the Pinterest embed block, you can embed pins, boards (a collection of pins), and Pinterest profiles into your posts and pages. You donât need a Pinterest account to be able to use it, but only public pins, boards, and profiles can be embedded.

**Examples of Pinterest embeds**:

# Wolfram embed <a name="documentation/article/wolfram-embed" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wolfram-embed/

[Go back to the list of **Blocks**](#documentation/article/blocks)

With the Wolfram embed block, you can embed [Wolfram Notebook](https://www.wolfram.com/featureset/notebooks/) content into your posts and pages (deployed through the Wolfram Cloud). All of the Wolfram services are tied together by the Wolfram Language: Wolfram Cloud Notebooks are the cloud-hosted version of Wolfram Language Notebooks.

****Example of a Wolfram embed:****

![Screenshot of  Wolfram](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/00-example-wolfram-embed-1.webp)

****Steps to embed Wolfram Notebook content****

1. First, find the Wolfram Notebook content that you want to embed. If already embedded in a page, open the Notebook in the Wolfram Cloud to locate and copy its wolframcloud.com URL.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/01-open-in-wolfram-cloud-link.webp)![Screenshot of Wolfram and the correct URL to copy to use the embed block.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/02-copy-url-browser-bar-wolfram-embed.webp)

2. Go to your post or page and add the Wolfram embed block. One way to do this is to press the â/â key to open the block inserter and type /wolfram.

3. Paste the link into the text box and click the âEmbedâ button.

![Embed option for the Wolfram block to paste the URL.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/04-paste-wolfram-cloud-url.webp)If the link can be successfully embedded into your post/page, you will see the preview in your block editor.

![Preview of the embedded Wolfram video within the WordPress editor.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/05-preview-editor-wolfram-embed.webp)If you use a URL that canât be embedded, the block displays the message: *âSorry, this content could not be embedded.â* You will have two choices: try again with a different URL or convert it to a link.

![Example of a URL that cannot be embedded. Two options are presented, try again or convert to link.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/06-incorrect-url-wolfram-embed.webp)4. Click the âPreviewâ button in the top right corner of the post/page to see how it will look on the front end.

- Transform to â also the icon for the block
- Change alignment
- Edit URL, and
- More options

![Block Toolbar with options available for the Wolfram embed](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/08-block-toolbar-wolfram-embed.webp)**Transform to**

![Options to transform the Wolfram block to Paragraph, Columns or Group.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/04/09-transform-to-option-wolfram-embed.webp)

Transforming it into a Group will give you the ability to change the following, among other options:

- The background color around the Wolfram embed
- The padding, margin, and spacing dimensions of the block
- The block border settings (width, style, color, and radius)

**Note**: you can preview what each block (paragraph, column, or group) will look like by hovering the mouse over each option.

# Work with blocks <a name="documentation/article/work-with-blocks" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-blocks/

Each content in the [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) is a block. They are the building blocks of your post or page.

The [WordPress Block Editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) offers an array of [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) that can be used to create media-rich pages and posts. You can control the layout of the blocks with ease, to build visually appealing web pages.

You can add [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) for paragraphs, images, headings, lists, videos, galleries, and [more](#documentation/article/blocks). WordPress has blocks for all common content elements, and more can be added by [WordPress plugins](#plugins/browse/blocks).

## The anatomy of a block 

Each block consists of a Block Toolbar, a Block Settings Sidebar, and the Block Content.

![Anatomy of a block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/03/Block-UI.png)Anatomy of a blockYou can edit, customize or move each block independent of the other blocks on the post or page.

The editing options in the Block Toolbar will vary based on the block you are currently editing.

Each of the blocks comes with its own formatting settings in the Block Sidebar settings panel which gives greater control over the layout and the look and feel of the block.

## How to add a block

There are different ways to add [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) to your post or page. You can add a block anywhere on the post or page using the + button (called the **Block Inserter)**. You can also use the search feature to quickly find the block you want and add it to the post or page.

Details on how to add a block to your post or page can be found [here](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).

## How to configure a block

Each block has its own set of tools to customize the layout and appearance of the block.

### Block toolbar

Select a block to reveal the **Block Toolbar** at the top of the block.

![Block Toolbar for the image block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/work-with-blocks-1.jpg)Block Toolbar for the image blockThe Block Toolbar includes the formatting options for the selected block. ***These options in the Block Toolbar will vary based on the block that is being inserted.***

Some of the most common options in the Block Toolbar are as follows:

**Transform**: Usually, the first option in the Block Toolbar is Transform (marked **1** in the [screenshot](#block-toolbar-options) below). This allows you to change the selected block into a list of other supported block types.

![Block Toolbar options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/work-with-blocks-2.jpg)Block Toolbar optionsFor example, if you add a Paragraph block and want to change it to a Quote block, Heading block, List block, or Pullquote block, clicking this icon will give you the options from the drop-down menu.

The transform options will vary based on the selected block.

When a block is transformed, the existing block styles are preserved after the block transformation.

When a block is transformed, the additional classes added in the Additional CSS class(es) section under Advanced in the Block Settings sidebar are also preserved after the block transformation.

**Drag**: Click and hold the icon that looks like six dots (marked **2** in the [screenshot](#block-toolbar-options) above) to drag the block to another section of the page.

**Move up/down**: Click the up or down arrow(marked **3** in the [screenshot](#block-toolbar-options) above) to move the block up/down one position on the page. Read more about [moving the blocks](#documentation/article/moving-blocks).

**More Options:** The three vertical dots(marked **4** in the [screenshot](#block-toolbar-options) above) open a menu with additional settings that help to further customize the block. Read more about the [More options](#documentation/article/more-options).

**NOTE**: When you click the three dots to the right of the Settings icon in the upper right corner and enable the **View** &gt; **Top toolbar** option, the block toolbar is combined to the top of the WordPress block editor instead of appearing directly above the block.

![Block toolbar combined to the top toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/work-with-blocks-3-1024x575.jpg)Block toolbar combined to the top toolbar

### Block settings

When you select a block, you will find additional settings in the sidebar to the right of the WordPress block editor.

In the sidebar, you can switch between settings for the current post or page (marked **1** in the [screenshot](#sidebar-settings) below) and settings for the selected block (marked **2** in the [screenshot](#sidebar-settings) below).

## How to lock and unlock a block

You can lock the movement and/or removal of a block.

From the Block Toolbar, click the three-dot menu option and select âlockâ. This will open a dialog box where you can check the options â âPrevent removalâ and/or âDisable movementâ. Once you click âApplyâ, the block is locked.

Based on the settings you choose when you locked the block, you will not be able to remove the block or move the block. You will see a lock icon in the Block Toolbar and also in the List View next to the block.

To unlock a locked block, click on the three-dot menu in the Block Toolbar and select âUnlockâ. This will open a dialog box where you can uncheck the options â âPrevent removalâ and/or âDisable movementâ.

Once you uncheck both the options and click âApplyâ, the block is unlocked. You will not see the lock icon in the Block Toolbar and also in the List View next to the block.

When you uncheck one of the two options -âPrevent removalâ and/or âDisable movementâ and click âApplyâ, you will still see the lock icon in the Block Toolbar and also in the List View next to the block. Based on the option that is checked, you will not be able to remove the block or move the block.

## How to remove a block

To remove a block, select the block and click the three dots in the Block Toolbar for the block. At the bottom of the menu, you find the option to remove that block.

![Remove a block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/work-with-blocks-6.jpg)Remove a block## How to find a block or block pattern

The [WordPress Block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) offers an array of blocks for every possible element you want to add to your site. To browse the list of [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks), click the **+ Block Inserter** in the upper left corner of the editor.

Here, you can find all the blocks divided into categories. When you hover over a block, it will show you a preview of the block with a brief description. Clicking on one of the block icons will add it to the post or page. If you know the name of the block, you can search for it in the search box at the top in the Block inserter.

You can also find the [block patterns](#documentation/article/block-pattern) (predefined groups of blocks) available for your theme and the [Synced patterns](#documentation/article/reusable-blocks) you have added to your site.

## How to find the most used blocks

You can set the [preferences](#documentation/article/preferences-overview) to keep the most-used blocks at the top of the list of blocks when you click on the Block inserter. This makes it easier for you to choose from the most used blocks on your site.

![Most used blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-14-at-2.01.21-PM-415x1024.png)Most used blocksHere are the steps to set the preference to keep the most-used blocks at the top of the list of blocks:

1. Click the ellipses icon (the three dots) at the top right corner of the editor screen.
2. Choose **Preferences** &gt; **Blocks**.
3. Toggle on âShow most used blocksâ.

## Tips when working with blocks

### Selecting multiple blocks

You can now select multiple blocks by partially selecting the contents inside the blocks â by mouse (drag), shift + click, and also the keyboard (shift + arrow). This is helpful to move or transform multiple blocks at once, to change the Block settings on multiple blocks, group or stack multiple blocks etc.

### Linking to existing post or page

You can quickly add links to existing an post or page in your content. Type two open brackets `[[` in your content to show a list of posts and pages and you can select the one to link to, from the list.

### Creating patterns

To avoid adding the same content to multiple posts or pages, you can save a block or group of blocks into a [Synced pattern](#documentation/article/block-pattern) which can be reused on any other post or page. This will save you time and effort. Eg: contact information, business hours, social media accounts, call to action button etc.

Learn more about Synced patterns [here](#documentation/article/reusable-blocks).

### Grouping blocks

You can group together multiple blocks into one group and treat them as a unit. This is helpful to edit, format (such as add a common background color, change the font color etc) or move a group of blocks. If you donât want them to be in a group, you can Ungroup your blocks as well.

Learn more about the Grouping blocks [here](#documentation/article/group-block).

## How to update what your homepage displays

Your homepage can show a list of your latest blog posts or a static page with custom content. Which setting you use depends on the templates that are included in your theme. To view the list of templates, go to the Administration Screen &gt; Appearance &gt; Editor &gt; Templates.

- If your theme does not have a Home or Front page template, select the Add New button and create a new Front Page.
- If your theme has a Front Page template, click on the link with the template name to open the editor.
- If your theme has a Home template, you can edit the template or set what you want to appear in the Administration Screen &gt; Settings &gt; Reading.

To learn how to select a static page for your homepage, please see the support article [Creating a Static Front Page](#documentation/article/creating-a-static-front-page).

Block themes display lists of blog posts with the Query Loop block and the Post Template block.  
The [support article for the Query Loop Block](#documentation/article/query-loop-block) explains how to configure the block.  
  
When you add a block inside the post template block, it is repeated for every post in the list. The Post Title and Post Featured Image, Post Author, Post Date, Post Category, and Post tags are examples of blocks that you can use to customize your blog.

**Static page**

If you have selected a static page for your home page, and you want it to have a different design than other pages, you need to assign it a different template.

Follow these steps to assign an existing template:

1. From your wp-admin dashboard, head to Pages &gt; All Pages.
2. From the list of pages, select the option to edit page you have set as your home page.
3. Once in the editor, open the settings sidebar.
4. Under âTemplateâ, you can then select whatever Template you want your home page to use.
5. When youâre done, select âUpdateâ to save the changes.

Follow these steps to create a new template:

1. From your wp-admin dashboard, head to Pages &gt; All Pages.
2. From the list of pages, select the option to edit page you have set as your home page.
3. Once in the editor, open the settings sidebar.
4. Under âTemplateâ, select New.
5. This will open the Site Editor to add blocks for create your template for your static homepage.
6. When youâre done, select âUpdateâ to save the changes.

Please note that if you add a Front Page template in the Site Editor, it will always be used as the front page regardless of what setting you choose under Admin &gt; Settings &gt; Reading. You will need to either customize that template to your liking or remove it to then adjust the homepage settings again.

## How to update your site icon

Block themes include the ability to use the Site Logo block which has built within it an option to set your Site Logo as your Site Icon. For context, the Site Logo simply displays whatever logo you set for your site whereas your Site Icon is also known as a favicon and it is used to help identify your website. To learn more about setting your Site Icon or favicon, please see the support article [Creating a Favicon](#documentation/article/creating-a-favicon).

Follow the steps below to use the same image for the Site Logo and Site Icon:

1. Head to Appearance &gt; Editor. This will open up your homepage.
2. Either find your Site Logo block added by your theme or add it to yourself wherever youâd like. Detailed instructions for adding blocks [can be found here](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).
3. From there, youâll see the option to upload or select an image to use from your Media Library.
4. After choosing an image and while still selecting the Site Logo block, open the block settings sidebar (uses the cog icon).
5. Under the settings for the Site Logo block, toggle on the option to âUse as site iconâ.
6. Save your changes.

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comment-template-block/

[Go to the List of Blocks](#documentation/article/blocks)

The *Comment Template* block is a part of the *Comments* block. It contains block elements to display comments, such as the comment author, avatar, and comment content.

## How to use the Comment Template Block

When you add a Comments block, the *Comment Template* block is included by default. Also, you can only insert a *Comment Template* block inside a Comments block. Since the *Comment Template* is a part of the Comments block, the content will change on the front-end depending on the query.

![Comment Template block](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lTEIwsk3Kl0fo5UgsiAQCEAGCYKFcEfHeLy3Iwp0kvti6KmwzgrbN2yl_NQaPo2l1JKn3MAK14vqmtmWsa1N0f4T6_dq-s6Zeoelm1hdPxwgN--ih6QW11fgMOl4Ndv6uvu2gh2_TJfRQIoSbYvDWg8)To add a *Comment Template* block, click the block inserter icon (**+**) inside the Comments block to open the block inserter pop-up window and search for the *Comment Template* block.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut /comment-template to insert a *Comment Template* block quickly.

Check the detailed instructions on how to add a block [here](#support/article/adding-a-new-block).

When the *Comments* block is added in the post editor, the *Comment Template* block will display the actual comments on the post and use a âNo results foundâ placeholder when thereâs no comment on the post yet.

![No results found placeholder](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/image-4.png)## Block toolbar

To view the block toolbar, click on the block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

Every block has unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.

The *Comment Template* block shows the following buttons:

# Border &amp; Shadow Settings overview <a name="documentation/article/border-settings-overview" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/border-settings-overview/

You can use the border and shadow settings in your [block](#documentation/article/blocks) to set a visible border or shadow on specific blocks. These settings allow you to control the width and radius on each side of the border. Some blocks also have the option to change the border color.

The border and shadow settings are available when you use the [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor). If you are new to the block editor, [this guide](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks) will show you how to work with blocks. You can read more about the new block editor features and improvements [in this article.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/26/core-editor-improvement-catalyst-for-creativity/)

## How to access border and shadow settings

The border and shadow settings can be found in the Block Settings sidebar of a [block](#documentation/article/blocks) under the section **Border**.

If you donât see the **Block Settings** sidebar, select the block you want to customize, then click the **settings** icon that is to the right of the **Publish** or **Update** buttons in the WordPress Editor.

In the **Border &amp; Shadow** section, shadow option may be hidden. Click on the three-dot border options menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the border and shadow settings that are not visible by default.

You can read more about [block settings here.](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks#block-settings)

![Border & Shadow section in the Block Settings sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/border-shadow-6.7.jpg)Screenshot

## Type of settings 

Each supported block comes with different border and shadow settings. If you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking **Reset All** as [shown in this article](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks#reset-controls). This resets the settings and removes all of your changes. Note that not every block supports all the border settings.

### Width 

The width setting allows you to define the width of the border on the four sides. You can type in a value in the text box or use the slider to adjust the value.

![Adding border width to a block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Edit-Page-Sample-Page-â¹-Coco-Woofs-â-WordPress.png)

You can click on the **Link** icon to unlink the sides and set separate values for the border width for the top, left, right and bottom.

![Setting separate border width values for the four sides.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-9.40.45-AM.png)You can choose to set border width using different units. Click the `px` icon to change the unit of measurement for the border thickness or radius. You can choose between `px`, `%`, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, and `vh`.

[Read more about what each of these units means.](#documentation/article/typography-settings-overview)

![Changing the unit of measurement ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-9.38.48-AM.png)

### Color

The border color for your block can be set using the style picker next to the border width as seen below. You can the colors from the theme palette or from the default colors in the theme.

![Changing the border width and color](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-9.43.26-AM-1-1024x663.png)If you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the **Reset to default** button at the bottom of the color picker. This resets the settings and removes all of your changes.

![Reset to default button](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-9.53.01-AM.png)### Style

From the color picker, you can also select one of the three border styles: straight line, dash line, and dotted line.

![Changing the border style](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-16-at-10.00.20-AM-1024x776.png)

### Radius 

The radius setting will give your block a more rounded border. Setting this to 0 means the block has sharp edges.

You can choose to set a border radius using different units. Click the `px` icon to change the unit of measurement for the radius. You can choose between `px`, `%`, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, and `vh`.

[Read more about what each of these units means.](#documentation/article/typography-settings-overview)

You can type in a value in the text box or use the slider to adjust the value.

You can click on the **Link** icon to unlink the radii and set separate values for the four corners. Below is an example of how you can have unlinked values to create a block with uneven round corners.

![How to change the border-radius ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/border-radius-WP-62-1024x420.png)Note that when you unlink the radii, hover over the radii text boxes to display a tooltip that shows which corner each of the four text boxes relates to as shown below:

![The border-radius control has labels indicating which corner of the block you are changing: Top left, top right, and so on.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/border-radius-control-hover-WP-62.png)### Shadow

The shadow setting will give your block a shadow effect behind it.

Tips: If you donât see the shadow option in the Border &amp; Shadow section, click the three vertical dots to the right of the section header and select Shadow option.

  
Click Drop shadow and select shadow effects.

![All color settings and Reset all](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/color-settings-all-settings-6.8-300x151.jpg)All color settings and Reset allIn the Color section, click on the three-dot menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the color settings that are not visible by default. Note that not every block supports all the color settings.

### Resetting all settings

If you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking **Reset all**. This resets the settings and removes all of your changes.

## Type of settings 

Each supported block comes with different color settings.

### Text and background colors

This option allows you to change the color of the text, and background on the block you are working on. A combination of these color settings can be used to call attention to your most important content.

You can pick a color from the color palette of your theme. You can also add a custom color from the color picker or enter the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values based on your brand. Click the two rectangle boxes next to the color slider to copy the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values.

Accessibility tests are built into the editor to warn you when the text may become hard to read against the background color choices as shown.

### Link colors

On some blocks, you will find the option to change the link color.

### Gradient background colors

Some blocks such as the [Heading block](#documentation/article/heading-block) allow you to set either a solid color or a gradient as the background. A gradient is a mix of two or more colors, displayed using a certain pattern (from lighter to darker, or one color blending into the other).

A slider will appear that shows the two color points that make up the gradient.

![Color points in the gradient](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/image-2.png)You can click on any of the two color points to display the color picker for changing the color value. You can either choose a color from the color picker or enter the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values.

You can add additional color points if you like by clicking the **+** icon that appears when you hover over the gradient slider.

![Gradient type](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/color-settings-gradient-type-1024x849.jpg)Screenshot

You can choose between the **Linear** or **Radial** gradient type. The angle control shifts the position of the gradient.

The **Linear** type creates a gradient between the two colors along a straight line, whereas the **Radial** type starts from the center and moves to the borders.

![Liner and Radial gradient options](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/gradient-example.png)

### Duotone filter

You can create a two-tone color effect (called the duotone effect) on images without actually changing the original image

The duotone filter option allows you to add this filter color to your block content from the block toolbar. The filter can be black, white, or *any* other color combination of your choosing. The duotone effect works best on high-contrast images.

To get started, select the Duotone filter icon in the block toolbar. You can pick the two colors for the effect from the list of duotone presets provided in the drop-down.

You can also pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights by clicking on the **Shadows** /**Highlights** option which opens up the color picker and then selecting your custom color from the color palette.

If you want to remove the duotone filter you can click the **Clear** button found at the bottom-right of the color palette.

## Reset settings

When hovering over the Color option, if a color has been selected, a reset button (displayed as a dash icon) will appear. Clicking this button will remove the applied color and reset the field to its default state, indicating âNo color selected.â

![Reset color button](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/color-reset.png)Reset color button## Demonstration

To illustrate the above settings, below is an example of how to add custom colors so that the social link icons will match the branding on your site:

# Layout Settings overview <a name="documentation/article/layout-settings-overview" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/layout-settings-overview/

The layout settings in [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) allow you to change the justification and orientation of the nested child blocks inside their parent blocks. These settings can be found in the parent blocks within which the child blocks are nested.

The layout settings are available when you use the [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor). If you are new to the block editor, [this guide](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks) will show you how to work with blocks. You can read more about the new block editor features and improvements [in this article.](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/26/core-editor-improvement-catalyst-for-creativity/)

## How to access layout settings

To access the layout settings (in the parent block), click on any of the child blocks. The first icon in the block toolbar of the child block will select the parent block. In the block settings sidebar in the parent block, you will find the **Layout** section as shown below.

![Layout Settings for blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/layout-settings-1.gif)## Navigating through nested blocks

The **List View** tool can be used to navigate between layers of content and nested blocks. This will make it easy to access the parent and child block.

![Top toolbar of the editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-4.43.32-PM-1.png)To open **List View**, select the List View icon from the Top Toolbar of the [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor) as shown above. It will remain open as you navigate through your content and stay open until you close it by either selecting the âxâ or by selecting the List View icon again.

[Learn more about the List View](#documentation/article/list-view).

![The list view of blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-21-at-3.32.17-PM-1024x926.png)

## Type of settings 

Each supported block comes with different layout settings. If you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking **Reset All** as [shown in this article](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks#reset-controls). This resets the settings and removes all of your changes.

### Justification 

You can set the justification of the child blocks inside the parent block. You can justify the child blocks to the **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**.

Some blocks like [buttons block](#documentation/article/buttons-block) will have the option to add **Space between items** which lets you add equal space between them. Space between items is applicable only for horizontal orientation. Eg: The *buttons block* is centered with equal spacing between the buttons if you have more than 1 button within the *buttons block*. *If the child blocks are set to be vertically aligned, you will not be able to put space between them.*

The justification settings can be found on the parent blockâs toolbar and sidebar settings.

![Layout settings for justifying blocks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/justification-2.gif)### Orientation 

When you first add multiple blocks to a parent block, the child blocks will be displayed horizontally (i.e. next to each other.)

Another option is to display the child blocks vertically (i.e., stacked in the parent block).

![Orientation for layout Parent Block Settings](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/orientation-1.gif)### Allow to wrap to multiple lines 

![Allow to wrap blocks to multiple lines. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/10/wrap.png)By turning on the **Allow to wrap to multiple lines** setting, the child blocks will move to the next line when there isnât enough space on smaller screen sizes *(mobile device)*. With this setting off, all the child blocks will stay on the same line no matter the screen size.

### Customizing layout width

Some blocks such as the [Query Loop](#documentation/article/query-loop-block) block that has nested inner blocks like [Post Template](#documentation/article/post-template-block) block and [Group block](#documentation/article/group-block) will have the following layout option that lets you choose the layout width for the nested blocks.

![Toggle off the option- Inner blocks use content width](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-23-at-2.58.53-PM.png)Toggle off **Inner blocks use content width** so that the nested inner blocks fill the width of the parent container.

![Toggle on the option- Inner blocks use content width](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2022/11/Screenshot-2022-11-23-at-3.04.05-PM.png)Toggle on ****Inner blocks use content width**** so that the nested inner blocks use content width with options for full and wide widths. You can set the value for full width by typing in a value in the **Content** textbox. You can also set the value for wide width by typing in a value in the **Wide** textbox. You can also set the unit in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, or VH for the **Content** width and **Wide** width. You can also change the **Justification** for the nested elements to left, center or right aligned within the parent container.

## Blocks that include layout settings

- Buttons
- Column
- Columns
- Comments Pagination
- Gallery
- Group
- Navigation
- Post Content
- Post Template
- Query
- Query Pagination
- Social Links

## Demonstration 

To see these specific container-related options in play hereâs an example with the navigation block where you can quickly switch between different configurations as you find which best fits with the header of your choosing.

## The difference between px, em, rem, %, vw, and vh units

Pixel (**px**) is not a scalable unit, it is an absolute unit. The **px** unit does not change based on any other element and hence **px** units are not responsive. They are useful for maintaining consistent sizing for some elements. If you have elements that should not be resized, then using **px** unit is a good option.

Element (**em**), root element (**rem**), **%**, viewport height(**vh**) and viewport width(**vw**) are relative units. They are suited for responsive designs because these units scale up and down based on other elements size. They also get interpreted into the equivalent **px** unit by the browser.

**em**: Relative to the parent element

**rem**: Relative to the root element (HTML tag)

**%**: % relative to the parent element

**vw**: Relative to the viewportâs width

**vh**: Relative to the viewportâs height

## Demonstration

To see the power of these settings in action, hereâs an example of using them to personalize a button.

# Position Settings overview <a name="documentation/article/position-settings-overview" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/position-settings-overview/

The position settings in [blocks](#documentation/article/blocks) allow you to set how an element is positioned in your site. These settings can only be found in a few blocks when they are placed at the root of site.

The position settings are available when you use the [block editor](#documentation/article/wordpress-editor). If you are new to the block editor, [this guide](#documentation/article/working-with-blocks) will show you how to work with blocks.

## How to access position settings

To access the position settings, either add a Group, Row, or Stack block to the root of your content, meaning not placed within another block. In the block settings sidebar of the block you added, you will find the **Position** section as shown below.

## Type of settings

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Sticky-positioning-horizontal-view-1-361x1024.png)Each supported block comes with two different position settings. Automatically, blocks will use the âDefaultâ option. You can switch between these two options as youâd like. If you do not see these settings, itâs because the block either doesnât support the positioning option or, if itâs one of the blocks listed under blocks that include these settings, the block is not placed in the root of your site, meaning not placed within another block.

### Default

This is the option chosen automatically. It allows a block to be positioned as it usually is in relation to other blocks.

### Sticky

This option allows you to keep top-level blocks fixed to the top of a page as visitors scroll. This matches the CSS property of the same name.

## Blocks that include position settings

As a reminder, this setting will only show for the following blocks when that block is placed at the root of your site, meaning not placed within another block.

- Group
- Row
- Stack

## Demonstration 

**Making a Header Template Part sticky**

A common use case for the sticky positioning option is having a header that sticks to the top of the page as a visitor scrolls. To accomplish this, follow these steps:

1. **Open [List View](#documentation/article/list-view)** and select the Header Template Part block. Ensure this Header Template Part block is not placed within another block.
2. Select the three dot menu either in List View or the block toolbar and choose the option to **Group**. This will wrap the Header Template Part block in a Group block.
3. Select the Group block that was just created and **open the Block Settings sidebar**.
4. Add a background color to the Group block under the Styles tab in the Block Settings. This ensures that when a visitor is scrolling, the items in the Header Template part arenât interfering with the rest of the blocks on the page.
5. Scroll down to the Position settings and choose **Sticky**.

For example, the *Clear unknown formatting* option might appear when you have copied and pasted content from a document editor such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word, or if you have used the *Edit as HTML* option in the [More options](#documentation/article/more-options) menu.

# Distraction Free mode <a name="documentation/article/distraction-free-mode" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/distraction-free-mode/

Distraction Free mode is a new visual option that creates a focused writing experience by hiding various parts of the editor interface. When enabled, any open sidebars are closed and toolbars fade away, leaving your content to take center stage. You can toggle this mode on/off as you write and as youâd like. This mode doesnât work in the [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor).

## How Distraction Free mode works

Distraction free mode works by adjusting the following interfaces and simplifying the writing experience:

- Removing the Top toolbar, making it only appear when you hover your cursor over it.
- Removes many Top toolbar buttons.
- Automatically closes any open sidebars.
- Hides various + options for adding new blocks.
- Hides the block toolbar.

## How to use Distraction Free mode

### How to find Distraction Free mode

To find Distraction Free mode, use the three-dot menu on the top right and check the Distraction free mode. Your choice will be stored in your browserâs local storage, meaning if you switch browsers or computers, you will have to switch into this mode once more.

![Visual of the settings open showing distraction free mode checked off with two red arrows pointing to where to take action. ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/04/Edit_Post_Distraction_Free_Mode_â¹_DEMO_â_WordPre.png)How to find Distraction Free mode.Keep in mind that you can use Distraction free mode with additional modes like Fullscreen mode or Spotlight mode.

### How to toggle on and off

To toggle this mode off, move your cursor to the very top of the editor until the top toolbar appears. From there, you can select the three-dot menu on the top right and un-check the Distraction free mode.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut â§ â \\ on Mac and Ctrl+Shift+\\ for Windows.

### How to show the top toolbar

To see the top toolbar in this view, move your cursor to the top of the editor. As you do so, the top toolbar will come back into view and will fade if you move your cursor away again.

### How to add blocks

Because this mode is built for writing, you can create new paragraphs by hitting enter. To add different kinds of blocks though, like a Heading or Image, you must use the slash command (`/`) as itâs the only way to add additional blocks. [Read more here](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).

## Demonstration of Distraction Free mode

**Changelog:**

- Updated 2024-11-04 
    - Updated the screenshot as it appears in the latest Gutenberg editor.
    - Updated the video record with one that shows how to navigate the top tool bar while in distraction free mode.

# Block Error: Unexpected or Invalid Content <a name="documentation/article/block-error-unexpected-or-invalid-content" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-error-unexpected-or-invalid-content/

## Error overview 

If youâre encountering this error message in the Block Editor, it typically means that there is a problem with the content youâre trying to insert or edit within a block. Usually, the error is displayed when the affected block contains content that has a formatting problem, this could happen because of a number of reasons explained in this article.

![Picture displaying a block error ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/Screenshot-2023-06-23-at-16.41.16-1024x152.png)**More Options**

As with other blocks, the affected blocks also include the **More options** menu in the block toolbar. You can access these options by clicking on the ellipses (three dots) in the block toolbar as shown below. The **Copy Block** option allows you to copy the block and its content to a clipboard, you can paste this content elsewhere in the editor or even on a different post/page.

[Read about the More Options settings and how to make use of them](#documentation/article/more-options)

![More options for the affected block ](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/more-options-block-error-1024x823.png)## Possible reasons a block displays an error

### The option to edit the block using HTML 

A blockâs toolbar provides an option to edit your blockâs HTML code.

![Showing the option to edit a block as HTML option](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/edit-as-html-1024x450.png)In this case, the error can be displayed when there is a syntax error. For example, adding two &lt;p&gt; opening tags before a closing tag &lt;/p&gt; on a Paragraph block or using the wrong syntax for adding a link as shown below.

### Unexpected HTML formatting

This can occur when the block editor detects a mismatch between the expected markup and the actual HTML content within a block. This error typically happens when HTML is manually added or copied into a block, and the block editor doesnât recognize it as valid content for that specific block type.

For example, adding Javascript to a block that isnât the [Custom HTML Block](#documentation/article/custom-html) or in the case shown below, adding inline CSS to a paragraph block. Style attributes arenât expected by the block so it will return an error.

### Plugin or Theme conflict

Itâs possible that a theme or plugin is interfering with the editor. Maybe your site isnât up-to-date, you didnât configure some important settings properly or there is some code conflicting with the blocks on the page. However, whatever the reason may be, you will need to do some troubleshooting to solve this kind of problem.

## Ways to solve the error

The block will give you several options to fix the error: Attempt Block Recovery, and an ellipsis (three-dot) button containing the options Resolve, Convert to HTML, and Convert to Classic Block.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/resolve-the-error-1024x520.png)You will have to be mindful of why you are receiving the error, in some cases these options will not be helpful for example when you have the wrong Syntax or you try to add Javascript or PHP code.

### Attempt Block Recovery

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/attempt-block-recovery--1024x361.png)Attempt Block Recovery button will restore the block as it was before the error appeared. This option will automatically remove the custom code and revert the block back to its previous safe state.

### Resolve

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/Resolve-1024x336.png)When you click on the ellipsis (three dots) button you will see more options, the first option is Resolve. When you choose to Resolve the block error, you will be provided with two options each with its own possible outcome.

#### Convert to HTML

On the left side, you have the option to convert the block to a Custom HTML Block, this will convert the invalid content directly into an HTML block and keep any HTML customization made. You can read more about [the Custom HTML block](#documentation/article/custom-html) in this guide.

#### Convert to Block

On the right side, you can convert the HTML code to Blocks, changes that will be made when that is done will be clearly displayed.

In the example below, converting the block to a Custom HTML block will keep the inline CSS added to change the font color to pink which would normally be stripped off by the Paragraph block.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/resolve-options-1024x251.png)### Convert to HTML

The third option is to convert to a Custom HTML block, this is the same function as the Convert to HTML option which is part of the Resolve option above.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/convert-to-html-block.png)### Convert to Classic Block

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/06/convert-to-classic-block.png)You can convert the invalid content into a [Classic Block](#plugins/classic-editor), this block contains the same options from the Classic Editor. The changes you would have made will be kept similar to converting the Custom HMTL block. You can go over [our Classic Editor guide](#documentation/article/write-posts-classic-editor) for an explanation of each of the options shown for the Classic Block.

# Site Editor Pages <a name="documentation/article/site-editor-pages" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor-pages/

Site Editor Pages is a page editing and page management tool in the Site Editor where you can create, view, edit, and trash pages. It shows your page content as part of the template instead of using placeholder content.

The Site Editor Pages menu is **only** available when you install and activate a [Block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) on your site. You can learn about the Site Editor in this support article: [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor).

In Site Editor Pages, you can edit both the page content and the template. The template is locked until you enable the template editing option.

Here you will also find the page details like information about the page status (for example, if a page is a draft or published) when the page was last updated, the number of words on the page, and how long it will take to read.

## How to access Site Editor Pages

Once you install and activate a Block theme on your site, go to **Appearance** &gt; **Editor** to open the Site Editor. In the sidebar menu, select **Pages**:

![The WordPress Site Editor with a menu on the left and a preview of the website to the right.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-first-menu-1024x534.jpg)## Sidebar features

When you select **Pages**, WordPress shows a sidebar with a list of pages, page-related shortcuts, and an option to create new pages.

You will find your site icon or the WordPress logo at the top of the sidebar. Clicking on this image takes you back to the WordPress dashboard.

Next is your site title and a button that opens the Command Palette. You will recognize the Command Palette button by the icon of the magnifying glass. You can select the back button if you want to go back to the main Site Editor menu.

![The page sidebar with a menu with all pages that are published or drafts.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-pages-sidebar-inner.png)### Page list

The page list includes all pages on your site that are either published or drafts. Each page in the page list is represented by an icon. Your front page uses an icon of a house. And if your site shows blog posts on a [separate page](#documentation/article/settings-reading-screen), the blog page uses an icon of a feather pen.

Clicking on the page title opens the page and the page details sidebar.

### Shortcuts

At the bottom of the sidebar are links that help you edit your site faster: Links to the 404-page template, the Search Results template, and Manage all pages, which takes you to the [Pages screen](#documentation/article/create-pages) in the WordPress admin.

### Save status

If you have unsaved changes to the page or the template, the save button at the bottom of the sidebar will be activated and highlighted with a blue background.

If there are unsaved changes to both the template and the page, you can review the changes before you save. Clicking the button opens a save modal where you can select if you want to save all changes:

![The save modal lists unsaved changes together with a checkbox. The checkbox is checked by default.
At the top of the modal is a save button and a cancel button.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-review-changes-1024x534.png)### The page details sidebar

This sidebar displays the name of the chosen page, a preview link for the front of the website, the featured image (if one exists), and a description.

**Page details:**

- Status â Draft or publishing date
- Slug
- Template â The name of the template that the page uses
- Words â The number of words in the content
- Time to read
- Last modified

![The page details sidebar displays information about the page below the page title.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-page-details-sidebar.png)The ellipsis menu next to the page title opens a modal where you can trash the page:

![The "Move to Trash" button.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-page-trash-1024x609.png)The pen icon represents editing: it redirects you to where you can edit the page in the Site Editor.

### The blog page details sidebar

Different types of pages show different details in the sidebar. When you select a page that displays the latest posts, you can update settings related to your blog directly in the sidebar. You can:

- Edit the page title
- Select the number of posts per page
- Allow or disallow comments

There are also two shortcuts to editing your site header and site footer.

![The blog page details sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-page-blog-details-sidebar.png)## Create new pages in the Site Editor

You can click the **plus icon** on the Site Editor Pages sidebar to draft a new page. Selecting this button opens a new modal where you can add an optional page title:

![The modal has an input field for adding a page title, a close button, a cancel button and a button that submits the form, with the text "Create draft".](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-new-draft-title.png)Selecting the **Create draft** button in the modal creates a new draft and redirects you to the screen where you can edit the new page.

## Edit pages in the Site Editor

To start editing a page in the Site Editor, click anywhere in the preview window or select a page from the Pages menu and click the pen icon.

When you edit pages in the Site Editor, you can see your page content in the template. Depending on the template, you may see your site header, the page content, and your site footer:

![The Site Editor displays a single page. The list view is opened and the blocks have icons that show that they are locked. The settings sidebar shows that the Pages template is used for this page.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-page-editing-1024x534.png)In the top right corner is a save button, a toggle button that opens the settings sidebar, a button that opens the [Styles interface](#documentation/article/styles-overview), and an options menu.

The page settings tab has four panels:

- The page title
- A summary panel with information about the page status and the publishing date.
- The content panel lists the editable blocks, such as the title and post content blocks.
- The template panel shows the name and preview of the current template.

**Status:**

You can use the status option in the summary panel to change the page to a draft, schedule it, or add a password:

![The status option is a modal where you can choose the page's publishing status from a row of radio boxes.
Draft, pending, private, scheduled and published.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-summary-panel-status.png)**Publish:**

You can use the publish option in the summary panel to change the publishing date of the page. You can enter a date and time using the input fields or select a date from the calendar. You can use the arrow buttons to change the month of the calendar.

![The publish option displays input fields for date and time.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-summary-panel-publish-527x1024.png)### Locked and editable blocks

Blocks in the **template** are locked and can not be selected without enabling the **Edit template** option. This prevents accidental editing of the template.

The blocks in the **content panel** in the settings sidebar can be edited, but not moved or deleted. These blocks can be selected, but do not have a block toolbar. Clicking on a block in the content panel selects the block in the editor.

In the example image below, the content panel includes a post featured image, the title block, and the post content block.

- Selecting the post featured image block will let you upload or add an image from the media library, but you can not remove the block.
- Selecting the title block will let you change the page title. But you can not change the titleâs color or font size.

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-content-panel.png)The content panel in the settings sidebarBlocks that are **placed inside the Post Content block** are editable. You can add new blocks, edit, move, and remove blocks. **These are the same blocks that you would see in the block editor when editing the page.**

In this example image, the editable blocks are the paragraph and quote blocks:

![](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-editing-list-view.png)The post featured image block, title, and post content blocks are locked in the list view. The blocks nested inside the post content block are unlocked and can be edited.## Enable template editing

When you click on a block in the template, WordPress shows a notification in the bottom left corner that says: Edit your template to edit this block.

![Edit template notification](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-template-blocks.png)You can also enable template editing by selecting the âEdit templateâ button in the template panel in the settings sidebar:

![The template panel in the settings sidebar shows the name of the template, a preview, and a "Edit template" button.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-editing-settings-template-panel.png)Now you are redirected, and you can make changes to the template.

To go back to the page, you can use the back button above the editor:

![The toolbar at the top of the editor.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/07/63-site-editor-pages-template-back.png)Or, you can click on the WordPress logo or site icon in the top left corner to open the Site Editor sidebar.

You can learn about the Site Editor in this support article: [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor).

The Site Editor navigation is **only** available when you install and activate a [Block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes) on your site.

You can do the follow actions using the Site Editor Navigation:

## Rename, duplicate, and delete menus

Once you select an individual menu, you will be able to rename, duplicate or delete it by clicking the **Actions** button next to its name.

# Footnotes block <a name="documentation/article/footnotes-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/footnotes-block/

WordPress 6.3 introduces a new feature to insert and display footnotes. This option can be found on the toolbar of individual blocks under the [Rich Editing](#documentation/article/more-text-editing-overview) option.

![Overview of how to insert Footnotes.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/footnote-block.png)## Adding the Footnotes Block

The Footnotes block will be added to your page or post as soon as you insert your first note using the Rich Text option. This new block works like other blocks and it can be moved around and removed.

From 6.4, the Footnotes block can be removed, a provision has been made to make re-insertion easier. Additionally, the footnotes block is now displayed in the inserter for improved discoverability. It will show even if anchors are not yet inserted into the content. This modification strÐµamlinÐµs and improvÐµs thÐµ discovÐµrability of thÐµ FootnotÐµs block, with thÐµ wider goal of crÐµating a morÐµ usÐµr-friÐµndly ÐµxpÐµriÐµncÐµ.

![The footnotes block can be added manually.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/footnotes-inserter.png)The text in the placeholder is a starting point, future refinements may include instructions on how to insert anchors.

![An empty footnotes block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/footnotes-block-empty-1024x433.png)The user experience was enhanced in the most recent update by giving placeholder instructions for scenarios where the Footnotes block is not available for custom post types. This enhancement seeks to provide users with clearer guidance by providing instructions when the Footnotes block is missing in specified instances.

![Footnotes block placeholder when it's not available on custom post types](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/image.png)Adding Footnote blocks to templates is also not possible at the moment but it is [being explored](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/52554).

Attempting to remove a Footnotes block triggers a warning regarding its removal and its impact. It advises that footnote references in the content area will continue to show if the block is removed. The user is required to confirm the deletion request before the block is deleted.

![The prompt when attempting to remove a footnotes block](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/image-3-1024x651.png)## Adding individual notes

To add new notes, highlight some text and open the âRich Textâ menu. Then select the âFootnotesâ option.

Notes are automatically linked to the original text and include a âgo backâ link for convenience.

If you move your blocks around after having added notes, the numbers and order of the notes will be automatically updated to match the changes you made.

## Customize the Footnotes Block

The Footnotes block has been improved with more design flexibility in this release. The block now has settings for [typography](#documentation/article/typography-settings-overview), [dimensions](#documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview), and [border](#documentation/article/border-settings-overview) control. [Color](#documentation/article/colors-settings-overview) support has been adjusted, with link and text now being the default, rather than background and text. These modifications attempt to give users more flexibility when it comes to modifying the Footnotes block.

Refer to this article for [detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).

## Using filters

While using a block with image, you can go to the **Style** tab and select a filter.

![Example of selected duotone filter](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/08/image-1024x560.png)The filter options provide several duotone preset to choose from. Alternatively, you can set the color for shadows and highlights yourself by clicking the color bar.

# Link control <a name="documentation/article/link-editing" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/link-editing/

[Go to the list of blocks](#documentation/article/blocks)

Use the links control to change how links are supposed to behave when interacting with the block editor.

First, you need to add a block with a hyperlink â a good example is the [paragraph block](#documentation/article/paragraph-block).

Refer to this article for [detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).

## Adding links

First, insert a hyperlink with the link icon. You can also use the Ctrl+K (or â+K) keyboard shortcut.

Clicking on the link icon will open a dialog box.

You can type in the URL of the page you want to link to.

You can also use the Search text box to search for pages on your own website. If you start typing a keyword into the Search text box, WordPress will list content titles on your website that match the keyword. This is helpful for on-site link building.

**Tip:** If you already have the URL of the website you want to link to in the clipboard, highlight the text, you want to make into a link and use Ctrl+V (or â+V) to add the hyperlink to the text.

## Open location

![Example of how to open the link on a new tab.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/01/image-7.png)The **Open in new tab** toggle switch allows you to control where the new page should open. By default, the switch is set to **off**.

- **off** opens in the same browser tab
- **on** opens in a new browser tab

This toggle option is also available when you open the link editing panel. Open the **Advanced** menu and you will see the same toggle switch as well as the **nofollow** option.

# Login-out block <a name="documentation/article/login-out-block" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/login-out-block/

[Go to the list of Blocks](#documentation/article/blocks)

The **Login-out** block allows you to automatically add a link anywhere on your site which lets your site users login and/or logout if they are already logged in.

## How to add the Login-out block

There are two ways you can use to add a ******Login-out****** block once you add a Navigation block:

- From the sidebar
- By typing forward slash (**/**)

### From the sidebar

Click on the (**+**) icon in the sidebar, and either select the *Login-out link* block from the list of your recently used blocks or click on *Browse all* to show all the available blocks and select it from there.

![login-out block by the sidebar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/browse-all-1.gif)### By typing back slash (/)

Type back slash (/) on your keyboard and then start typing *login*. You should notice a small popup with suggestions. Select the *Login/out* *block* option from the popup itself.

![login-out block by typing back slash](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/login-out-block-1.gif)Refer to this article for [detailed instructions on adding blocks](#documentation/article/adding-a-new-block).

## Block toolbar

Each block has its own toolbar, which contains unique controls that let you customize or configure the block. The *Login/out* block has the following options on its toolbar:

![login-out block toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/image-5.png)**Block moving tools**

![login-out block toolbar highlighting the drag tool](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/12/login-out-block-drag-n-drop-option.png)You can reorder *Login/out block* on the page. Use the toolbar to *move* the items *top and* bottom or *drag* them to the line above or to the line below.

**More options**

The **Options** section opens block settings to update it. You can also *copy, duplicate, lock*, or *remove your Login/out*.

Details about **More options** can be found in this [support article](#documentation/article/more-options).

## Block settings

Each link has its **Block settings** you can access by clicking the **settings** button on the upper-right corner of the editor or via **Options** in the toolbar.

**Settings**

There are 2 options under settings for the *login/out* block.

1. Display login as form. 
    - This setting displays the login form instead of just showing the login link.
    - The logout link stays unchanged with this setting.
2. Redirect to current URL. 
    - When this setting is enabled, the user after successful login lands to the previous URL he was trying to access before login.

**Typography**

The *Login/out* block provides typography settings to change the font family, appearance, line height, letter spacing, decoration, letter case, and font size.

For details refer to this support article: [Typography settings overview](#documentation/article/typography-settings-overview)

**Advanced**

The **Advanced** section has the **Additional CSS classes(es)** option. You can integrate your custom style into a **Login/out** block by inserting your CSS Class name into this field.

## Post Formats

This short guide will explain what the available [Post Formats](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/post-formats/) are, how to select the post format, and show you how each post format is presented.

### What are the available Post Formats?

In addition to the Standard Format (regular blog posts) there are seven additional formats you can choose to publish. To clarify what the other Post Formats are:

The **Aside Format** is for shorter posts of about 1 paragraph. Because theyâre shorter and meant to be digested quickly the title of the Aside post is hidden on Index pages.

The **Link Format** looks a lot like the Aside post but if youâre using the Twenty Eleven Ephemera Widget to display a list of your recent Aside and Link posts (found in Appearance â Widgets) the title of your Link posts will point to the URL of the first link in your post instead of pointing back to the post on your blog.

The **Gallery Format** is meant for posts using the Gallery shortcode. Gallery posts will show a thumbnail from your galleries on Index pages.

The **Status Format** is for short personal updates. Each Status post will show the avatar of the post author alongside the content.

If you have a post thatâs almost entirely a quote, the **Quote Format** will make those quotes stand out.

The **Video Format** is meant for posting a single video, which will appear with minimal post meta above the post to help your video content shine.

The **Image Format** is meant for posting one image and one image only. Here the post meta, seen below your post, is presented more like a caption for the post.

### How do I select Post Formats?

- Navigate to âPosts &gt; Add Newâ.
- Add content according to the post format you want to publish per explanation above.
- Open the Posts panel in the right sidebar and select the format you want for this particular post.
- Publish your new post.

## Patterns

1. Click the + icon to add a new block.

# Twenty Sixteen <a name="documentation/article/twenty-sixteen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-sixteen/

[Twenty Sixteen](#themes/twentysixteen) is the default theme for WordPress in 2016.

![The screenshot of Twenty sixteen with a black border, white background, black text and a blue accent color.
The screenshot shows a blog post with a photo of a sunset over water, and a sidebar with text, a search form, and category links.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2024/02/twenty-sixteen-screenshot.png)Twenty Sixteen is a modernized take on an ever-popular WordPress layout â the horizontal masthead with an optional right sidebar that works perfectly for blogs and websites. It has custom color options with beautiful default color schemes, a harmonious fluid grid using a mobile-first approach, and impeccable polish in every detail. Twenty Sixteen will make your WordPress look beautiful everywhere.

![Twenty Sixteen mobile design.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/Twenty-Sixteen-mobile-nav-open.png)![Twenty Sixteen tablet design.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/Twenty-Sixteen-ipad-portrait.png)

**Quick Specs**

1. The main column width is up to 840px.
2. The sidebar column width is up to 300px.
3. The recommended Featured Image size is 1200px wide.
4. The recommended Custom Header image size is 1200px wide and 280px height.

## No-Sidebar Layout

If youâd like to keep your visitorsâ focus squarely on your content, simply donât add any [widgets](#documentation/article/manage-wordpress-widgets) to the sidebar widget area. This also allows you to give your posts a powerful visual boost by adding a large [Featured Image](#documentation/article/page-post-settings-sidebar), up to 1200px wide.

![Twenty Sixteen blog post design without sidebar. The post has a wide featured image below the post title, above the content.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/Twenty-Sixteen-post-no-sidebar-446x1024-1.png)## Content Bottom Widget Areas

Twenty Sixteenâs two Content Bottom Widget Areas are handy spots where you can place supplementary content. On single posts and pages, these widget areas display below your content. To add widgets to them, Click **Appearance &gt; Widgets** from the [Administration Screen](#documentation/article/appearance-widgets-screen-classic-editor) and add your favorite widgets to **Content Bottom 1** or **Content Bottom 2** or both.

![A screenshot of a blog post with two widgets below the content.
The left most widget shows the recent posts. The second widget shows a newsletter signup form.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/twentysixteen-content-bottom-widgets1.webp)## Post Intro

Twenty Sixteen has a small but nifty intro feature. Also known as a âdeckâ or âkicker,â the intro area is displayed between the headline and body copy. Your intro can provide important information and act as a link between the title and the rest of your post. A carefully crafted deck grabs readersâ attention, giving them an idea of what to expect in the full post.

Add your intro in the [Excerpt option](#documentation/article/what-is-an-excerpt-classic-editor) in your Post panel.

## Overhanging Full-Size Image

Have you ever wanted to show off your large images without sacrificing the postâs readability? On a large screen, full-size images wider than or equal to 840px overhang the column.

## Pull Quotes

Pull quotes are a great way to refocus your readersâ attention â just add a class of `alignleft` or `alignright` to a `blockquote` element. Here are some examples of how to do that in the [Classic Editor](#documentation/article/write-posts-classic-editor).

```

<blockquote class="alignleft">A bolder pull blockquote that aligns to the lef</blockquote>

<blockquote class="alignright">A bolder pull blockquote that aligns to the right</blockquote>
```

On a large monitor, the left-aligned pull quote overhangs the main column to maintain the readability of the text wrapped around it.

![A screenshot of a large section of text with two pullquotes:  One left aligned that extends outside of the main column, and a right aligned that is aligned with the right side of the main text column.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/twentysixteen-pull-quotes.jpg)## Customize

Open the [Customizer](#documentation/article/customizer) to check out the four featured color schemes you can use to instantly change the look of your website.

- (Default)
- Red
- Gray
- Dark
- Yellow

Personalize the design even further by adding a Custom Header Image or/and Site Logo.

![An image of the color schemes in Twenty Sixteen: dark (black), red, yellow and grey.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/11/twentysixteen_color_schemes3.webp)## Social Menu

With Twenty Sixteen, you can display links to your social media profiles with perfectly sized icons in the footer, using the Social Links menu. You can manage menus under [Appearance &gt; Menus](#documentation/article/appearance-menus-screen).

Linking to any of the following sites will automatically display its icon in your menu:

- CodePen
- Digg
- Dribbble
- Dropbox
- Email (mailto: links)
- Facebook
- Flickr
- Foursquare
- GitHub

# Twenty Seventeen <a name="documentation/article/twenty-seventeen" />

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-seventeen/

[Twenty Seventeen](#themes/twentyseventeen) is the new default theme for WordPress in 2017. Its business-oriented design highlights new video headers, and it has a front-page layout that can be created by combining page sections. The theme can be customized further using custom color options and by adding a site logo, social menu, and widgets.

![Two screenshots of Twenty Seventeen, one for desktop and one for mobile.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/twenty-seventeen-1058.jpg)## Quick Specs

- The main column width is up to 525px for the two-column layout and 740px for the one-column layout.
- The sidebar column width is up to 326px.
- The recommended size for featured images is 2000px wide by 1200px high.
- The recommended size for header videos and header images is 2000px wide by 1200px high.

## Header Media

Twenty Seventeen supports both header images and header videos. To modify either type on your site, navigate to Customizer &gt; Header Media.

![The Customizer is opened and shows the preview of the site. The settings panel shows the options for the Header Media, including an option for selecting a header video.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/video-headers.png)For header videos, you can upload your own `mp4` video or link to a video hosted on YouTube. Smaller file sizes will help make sure your site is loaded quickly.

A header image can be used on its own to display a large photograph at the top of your site. It can also be used as a video fallback: If both a video and image are added, the image will be used as a placeholder while the video loads, and it also acts as a fallback on smaller screens where videos may be harder to serve over mobile networks.

## Front Page

Twenty Seventeen allows you to build a striking front page composed of content from different pages on your site. Each pageâs featured image is highlighted, displayed at full-screen size with a fixed position. Twenty Seventeen has four different sections you can assign pages to.

To set this up, first navigate to Customizer &gt; Static Front Page, and set your site to use a static front page if you havenât already.

![The Customizer is open and shows a preview of the site, as well as the Static Front Page settings.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/front-page.jpg)Navigate to Customizer &gt; Theme Options. Under each `Front Page Section # Content` header, select a page youâd like to display for that section.

![The Customizer is open and shows a preview of the site. The settings panel shows the Page Layout options which are custom options for Twenty Seventeen.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/theme-options.jpg)If you havenât created any pages yet, you can do that from the Customizer by clicking `+ Add New Page` beneath any of the sections. This will allow you to create a new page from the Customizer that you can later add content to.

For the best appearance, make sure each page includes a featured image and some content.

You can also select your Blog Posts page, and the panel will display your three latest blog posts.

![An example of the Page Layout options for the front page, with the page section in view.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/blog.jpg)Once youâve finished adding pages to the sections, click `Save & Publish`.

If youâd like to change the number of sections you can add pages to, add this snippet to your themeâs `functions.php`:

```php
`add_filter( 'twentyseventeen_front_page_sections', 'prefix_custom_front_page_sections' );<br></br>function prefix_custom_front_page_sections( $num_sections ) {<br></br>    return 6;<br></br>}`
```

This snippet changes the default four sections to six.

## Custom Colors

Twenty Seventeen includes three color options: the default light color scheme, a dark color scheme, and a Custom Colors scheme that can be adjusted to various hues using a slider.

![Six screenshots that show the color schemes in the Customizer: Light, dark and custom color hues.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/colours-screenshot.png)To explore all the color options available, navigate to Customizer &gt; Colors.

## Language Support

Twenty Seventeen includes optimal font styles for many languages, thanks to feedback from the WordPress community. The theme uses [Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin) by default and makes adjustments to the typography for the following alphabets:

- Arabic
- Chinese
- Cyrillic
- Devanagari
- Greek
- Gujarati
- Hebrew
- Japanese
- Korean
- Thai

To improve legibility, Twenty Seventeen also removes its letter-spacing styles for all non-Latin alphabets.

## One- and Two-Column Layouts

For [pages](/support/article/pages/), Twenty Seventeen allows you to choose between a one- and two-column layout. This can be changed via Customizer &gt; Theme Options. The theme defaults to the two-column layout, which displays the page title in one column and the page content in the other.

Note: This feature only becomes available after setting a static front page.

![The Customizer Theme Options panel for single pages.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/two-column-option.jpg)When the one-column layout is selected, both the page title and content display in a wider single column, centered on the page.

![The theme's two column layout, with the post title on the left and the content on the right.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/two-column.jpg)![The theme's one column layout, with the post title above the content.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/one-column.jpg)## Widgets

Twenty Seventeen includes a footer [widget](/support/article/wordpress-widgets/) [](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets)area allowing widgets to be added below the siteâs content.

The blog index, archive, and search pages and single blog posts also include a sidebar widget area. For each of these pages, the content is displayed in one center column if there is no sidebar. With the sidebar, the content is displayed in one column and the widgets are displayed in the other.

## Pullquotes

Pullquotes can be used to direct your readersâ attention to a particular passage or add visual interest to your posts and pages. In Twenty Seventeen, you can pair a pullquote with an `alignleft` or `alignright` class on the `blockquote` element to further highlight it. Instructions on how to do this can be found in [the support article for the Classic Editor](#documentation/article/write-posts-classic-editor). See the following example:

```
<blockquote class="alignleft">This is my fabulous left-aligned pullquote.</blockquote>
```

When a two-column layout is used (whether via the Customizer for pages, or by adding a sidebar widget for posts), the pullquote aligned to the same side will display fully outside of the content area and below the second column. Note: This will only work when the pullquote appears in the content below where the second column ends.

![A pullquote that is positioned to the left of the main content.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/pullquotes.jpg)## Post Formats

Twenty Seventeen supports the following post formats:

- Aside
- Audio
- Gallery
- Image
- Link
- Quote
- Video

## Social Icons

Twenty Seventeen includes a Social Icons Menu, allowing you to add links to your social media profiles that will be displayed as logos in the footer. If youâre not familiar with this functionality, please refer to the [documentation from Twenty Fifteen](/support/article/twenty-fifteen/#add-social-icons).

Source: https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-nineteen/

[Twenty Nineteen](#themes/twentynineteen) is the new default theme for [WordPress Version 5.0](/support/wordpress-version/version-5-0/). At the core of Twenty Nineteen is its simple, sophisticated typography. The themeâs aesthetic is minimal and non-prescriptive, allowing it to work well in a variety of applications. For example: it is effective as an minimal, typography-driven blogging theme, but can also be adapted for use as a static business website.

![](https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/12/Twenty-Nineteen-Business-In-Devices.jpeg?fit=1024%2C943&ssl=1)Twenty Nineteen Web and Mobile views## Quick Specs

- There is one widget area in the footer with a column width of 1032px.

## Full Block Editor Support

The block editor introduced in WordPress 5.0 grants users an unprecedented level of freedom to customize their siteâs layout and design. In order to fully achieve their vision, users will need a new generation of flexible themes, built to take advantage of the creative freedom that the block editor offers. Twenty Nineteen is built with this in mind and includes both front-end and editor styles for all core blocks that ship with WordPress in 5.0. This means that what you see in the editor will look almost exactly like what you see on the front end.

![A screenshot of a post in Twenty Nineteen that uses the Cover block.
The block settings are opened and shows the color options.](https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/12/Twenty-Nineteen-Post-Editor-Gutenberg.jpeg?fit=1024%2C687&ssl=1)## Site Logo

Twenty Nineteen supports a Site Logo which works great as an avatar for a personal blog or an business logo or icon. To modify it on your site, navigate to Customizer &gt; Site Identity.

![The Customizer is open and shows the preview of the site and the settings panel for the Site Identity. The options include the logo, site title and tagline.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/12/File_Twenty-Nineteen-Site-Logo.jpg)## Custom Colors

Twenty Nineteen uses a blue accent color by default. That color can be customized using a color hue slider. To explore the color options, navigate to Customizer &gt; Colors.

![The Customizer is open and shows the preview of the site and the settings panel for the colors. The custom color option is enabled, and a teal color has been selected.](https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/12/Twenty-Nineteen-Color-Options.png?fit=1024%2C621&ssl=1)By default, Twenty Nineteen applies a color filter to featured images using the color selected here. This can be disabled by deselecting the âApply a filter to featured images using the siteâs primary colorâ checkbox. Please not that when this option is disabled, the theme will still apply a black overlay on the featured image on single pages, in order to preserve the readability of the text that sits on top of the image.

## Language Support

Twenty Nineteen includes optimal font styles for many languages, thanks to feedback from the WordPress community. The theme uses local system fonts by default and makes adjustments to the typography for the following alphabets:

- Arabic
- Chinese
- Cyrillic
- Devanagari
- Greek
- Gujarati
- Hebrew
- Japanese
- Korean
- Thai

## Widgets

Twenty Nineteen includes a widget area below the siteâs content, just above the footer.

[Twenty Twenty](#themes/twentytwenty) is the new default theme for [WordPress Version 5.3](/support/wordpress-version/version-5-3/). It is designed with the flexibility of the block editor at its core. If you want to use it for an organization or a business, you can combine columns, groups, and media to create dynamic layouts that show off your services or products. If you want to use it for a traditional blog, the centered content column and considered typography makes it perfect for that as well.

Here, you can set the background color of the image overlay, the opacity of the image overlay, and the color of the text displayed on top of the overlay. You can also select whether the background image should have a fixed position when the visitor scrolls, which creates a gentle parallax effect.

## Custom Background Color

Twenty Twenty includes the option to change your siteâs background color.

[![A screenshot of the Customizer with the preview of the site and with the Colors & Dark Mode settings panel opened.](#documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Colors.png)](#documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Colors.png)Add your own custom color, or select a color from the palette.

[![The Dark Mode option in the Customizer.](#documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Color-Palettes.png)](#documentation/files/2020/11/TT1-Customizer-Color-Palettes.png)The colors of the elements on your site are automatically calculated based on the background colors you pick. This ensures that the color contrast is always high enough to be accessible to all visitors.

## Site Logo

Twenty Twenty-One includes a site logo setting which can be used to display the logo of your business or an image of yourself. You can set your site logo by going to Customizer â Site Identity.

The recommended size of the logo is at least 300px wide, or at least 100px tall. The logo is visible in the header and footer.

[![The Site Identity settings panel in the Customizer.](#documentation/files/2020/12/TT1-Centered-Logo.png)](#documentation/files/2020/12/TT1-Centered-Logo.png)  
The logo in the site header is centered. If you want to hide the Site Title and Tagline, the logo is placed to the left of the menu:

![The Customizer Excerpt settings have two radio buttons where you can can choose between summary and full text.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/01/tt1-excerpt-settings.png)Here you can choose if the blog and archive pages should show the full content or only the summary.   
The default is summary. The search result page always shows the summary.  
When the summary is selected, only text will be displayed.

## Menus

Twenty Twenty-One includes two menu locations:

- A traditional responsive horizontal menu at the very top of the site, which supports dropdown menus.
- A horizontal menu between the widget area and the footer at the bottom of the screen, which only supports one level of navigation.

You can choose a menu location by going to Appearance â Menus, where you can assign a menu to the âPrimary Navigationâ or the âFooter Navigationâ. You can also use both menu locations in combination, if you prefer.

### Menu descriptions

The primary navigation menu supports menu descriptions.

![The menu description is shown below the menu item text.](https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2021/01/tt1-menu-description-front.png)To enable menu descriptions, go to Appearance â Menus**,**  and open the Screen Options tab at the top of the page.

- Use the Social Icons block within the editor.

When you create a social menu, the text label you provide will be hidden, and an icon will be shown in its place. If youâre not familiar with this functionality, please check out the [documentation from Twenty Fifteen](#documentation/article/twenty-fifteen).

## Dark Mode Support

One of the accessibility features of the Twenty Twenty-One theme is support for the visitorâs color scheme preferences in their operating system or browserâs settings. The feature is opt-in and supported in most operating systems, including [Android](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9275525?co=GENIE.Platform=Android&hl=en), [iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210332), [OSX](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208976), [Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6), as well as most Linux distributions.

If you have Dark Mode enabled, your site will be shown to visitors using a light or dark color scheme, respecting their operating systemâs preferences. Depending on their lighting conditions or personal preferences they may choose to switch color schemes using a dedicated button on the bottom-right of their site (or bottom-left for RTL languages).

### Enabling Dark Mode from the Customizer

To activate Dark Mode Support, you can go to the Colors &amp; Dark Mode section in your Customizer. If you have a light color selected for the siteâs background, you will be able to see and activate the `Dark Mode Support` setting. The background color you select will be applied to light mode, while Dark Mode colors are optimized automatically. You can use the Dark Mode On/Off button at the bottom of the preview screen to toggle between dark &amp; light schemes in your preview.

### Dark Mode in the Editor

The editor will by default respect your operating systemâs color scheme settings. If on the front of your site you have chosen a different scheme (using the Dark Mode On/Off button), then the editor will use the preferred scheme.

Twenty Twenty-Two aims to help you achieve that by offering a wide set of patterns, templates, headers, footers, and custom color palettes. As the first-ever default [block theme](#documentation/article/block-themes), Twenty Twenty-Two invites you to explore full site editing and create a site that reflects your individual vision.

## Quick Specs

- Requires at least WordPress 5.9.
- Requires at least PHP version 5.6.

## Full Site Editing Support

Twenty Twenty-Two is designed to support all of the features of full site editing. This includes the following:

- [Site Editor](#documentation/article/site-editor): an editor that allows you to edit all parts of your site, navigate between templates, and more.
- [Styles](#documentation/article/styles-overview): a feature that allows you to customize your site, including individual blocks, as much as youâd like with different colors, typography, layouts, and more.
- [Templates](#documentation/article/template-editor): edit, create, and manage templates that a page or posts uses.

Thanks to these options you should find that you wonât need to switch themes as often to create the desired look and feel of your site.

Keep in mind that Twenty Twenty-Two is designed to use the above features instead of the Customizer to edit your site. The Customizer will be hidden by default, though it may be reactivated if you have plugins installed that require it.

## Templates

Twenty Twenty-Two has three custom templates for you to use with your posts and pages:

- Blank: this includes the post content without any additional blocks.
- Page (Large Header): this includes a big, visually interesting headline.
- Single Post (No Separators), and Single Page (No Separators): These are the standard post/page templates, but with no horizontal separators on them.

When exploring these templates and making them your own, be sure to take advantage of the Page patterns that you can use to build your templates.

## Block Patterns

Twenty Twenty-Two comes with 64 patterns to create beautiful content from footers, headers, pages, and more. To learn more about block patterns and how to use them on your site, please read the [Block Patterns support article](#documentation/article/block-pattern).

You can use these colors throughout your site including when customizing your site with [the Styles feature](#documentation/article/styles-overview) or when customizing individual blocks.
