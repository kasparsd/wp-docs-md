That&#8217;s why most major sites use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a site\u2019s using HTTPS, you\u2019ll see a little padlock icon in the address field, just as in the screenshot below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"335\" height=\"29\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/image.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the &quot;secure site&quot; padlock icon\" class=\"wp-image-11345908\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/image.png 335w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/03/image-300x26.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the most common reasons you might want to use HTTPS on your own site:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Faster.</strong> One might think that HTTPS would make your site slower, since it takes some time to encrypt and decrypt all data. But a lot of efficiency improvements to HTTP are only available when you use HTTPS. As a result, HTTPS will actually make your site faster for almost all visitors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trust.</strong> Users find it easier to trust a secure site. While they don&#8217;t necessarily know their traffic is encrypted, they do know the little padlock icon means a site cares about their privacy. Tech people will know that any servers between your computer and the web server won\u2019t be able to see the information flowing forth and back, and won\u2019t be able to change it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Payment security.</strong> If you sell anything on your site, users want to know their payment information is secure. HTTPS, and the little padlock, assure that their information travels safely to the web server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Search Engine Optimization.</strong> Many search engines will add a penalty to web sites that don\u2019t use HTTPS, thus making it harder to reach the best spots in search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your good name. </strong>Have you noticed that some websites have the text \u201cnot secure\u201d next to their address? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That happens when your web browser wants you to know a site is NOT using HTTPS. Browsers want you to think (rightly!) that site owners who can\u2019t be bothered using HTTPS (it\u2019s free in many cases) aren\u2019t worth your time and certainly not your money. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In turn, you don&#8217;t want browsers suggesting you might be that kind of shady site owner yourself.</p>\n",
