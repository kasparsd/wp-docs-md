The documentation for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-based-widgets-editor/\">Block-based Widgets editor can be found here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themes usually have at least 1 or 2 sidebars. Each section in the sidebar is known as a &#8220;Widget&#8221; that you can add or remove, and move up or down. You configure Widgets in your sidebar by via the <strong>Appearance Widgets Screen</strong>. Some themes also are configured to accept widgets in certain parts of the footer and header.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/?attachment_id=11132735\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"932\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/wigets-screen.png?fit=932%2C606&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11132735\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/wigets-screen.png 932w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/wigets-screen-300x195.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/01/wigets-screen-768x499.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px\" /></a><figcaption>widgets screen</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Widgets Management in Customizer</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add, rearrange and remove Widgets just like in Appearance  Widgets Screen, but you also get a live preview of your changes.
