The small bubble with the number in it shows the number of  approved comments that post has received. If the bubble is gray, you  have moderated all comments for that post. If it is blue, there are  pending comments. Clicking the bubble will filter the comments screen to  show only comments on that post.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sortable Columns</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Some column headings, such as the Author, and In Response To, can be\nclicked to sort the Table of Comments in ascending or descending order.\n Hover over the column title, for example Author, to see the up-arrow or\n down-arrow.  Click the heading to change the sort order.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Page Navigation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the Screen Options, the number of Comments displayed per page\nis determined.  If more then one page of Comments is available, two\ndouble-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided.\nAlso two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or\nforward.  Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to\nenter a page to directly display.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Screen Options</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Screen Options  allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in  the underlying Table.  Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list  of the columns with a check-box next to each column.  Check the box for  each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not  display that column.  In addition, the number of items you want  displayed in the table can be set.  Choose 1 to 999.  Click the Screen  Options tab again to close the Screen Options. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Search</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Above the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a\nword, or series of words, and click the &#8220;Search Comments&#8221; button to\nsearch and display all the comments meeting your search words.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Filtering Options</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top of this Screen are links such as All, Pending, Approved,\nSpam, and Trash, that when clicked, will cause just the comments of that\n type to be displayed in the underlying Table.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below that and to the right of the Bulk Actions Apply button, is another filter option:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Show all comment types</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This drop-down allows you to select, by type, which Posts are displayed in the Table of Comments.   By default, &#8220;Show all comment types&#8221; is selected and all of the  comments are displayed.  Besides all comment types, this pull-down offers  the ability to filter just comments or just pings. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using Selection, Actions, and Apply</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Selection</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\nThis Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more\ncomments selected in the Table.  For Bulk Actions to be performed on\nmultiple comments at once, those comments must be first <strong>selected</strong> via one of these methods:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Select one comment at a time</strong> &#8211; To select a comment, the\ncheckbox to the left of the comment entry must be checked (clicked).  It\n is possible to keep selecting more comments by checking their\nrespective checkbox.</li><li><strong>Select all comments in given Table</strong> &#8211; All comments in a given\ntable can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table&#8217;s title, or\nfooter bar.

A Reverse\nSelection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and\nclicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Actions</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>\nActions describe the process to be performed on particular\ncomments.
