The Posts are the writings, compositions or discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"all-posts\">All Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Via the <a href=\"/support/article/posts-screen/\">All Posts Screen</a> you can select the Post or Posts you wish to edit, delete, or view. Multiple Posts can be selected for deletion and for editing. A powerful bulk edit feature allows you to change certain fields for a group of Posts. A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Post. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Posts you want to edit or delete.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"add-new-post\">Add New Post</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/support/article/writing-posts/\">Posts Add New Screen</a> is where you write new Posts. While you are writing those Posts, you can also create new Categories and new Tags. In addition, any Media (pictures, video, recordings, files) can be uploaded and inserted into the Posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"categories\">Categories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories. Categories allow the classification of your Posts into groups and subgroups, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation and use of your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each Category may be assigned to a Category Parent so that you may set up a hierarchy within the category structure. Using automobiles as an example, a hierarchy might be Car-&gt;Ford-&gt;Mustang. In creating categories, recognize that each category name must be unique, regardless of hierarchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When using the WordPress default theme, all the Categories to which a given post belongs are displayed under that post. When someone viewing your blog clicks on one of those Category links, a archive page with all the Posts belonging to that Category will be displayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts Categories Screen\">Posts Categories Screen</a> allows you to add, edit, and delete Categories, as well as organize your categories hierarchically. Multiple Categories can be selected for deletion. A search option allows you to find the Categories you want to edit or delete. Also remember Categories can be added in the <a href=\"/support/article/writing-posts/\">Posts Add New Screen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tags\">Tags</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tags are the keywords you might assign to each post. Not to be confused with Categories, Tags have no hierarchy, meaning there&#8217;s no relationship from one Tag to another. But like Categories, Tags provide another means to aid your readers in accessing information on your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When using the WordPress default theme, Tags are displayed under each Post those Tags are assigned. Someone viewing your blog can click on one of those Tag links, and an archive page with all the Posts belonging to that Tag will be displayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts Tags Screen\">Posts Tags Screen</a> allows you to add, change, or delete Tags. Multiple Tags can be selected for deletion. A search option allows you to find the Tags you want to edit or delete.

Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when writing a Post or Page. Note that the Uploading Files section in the <a href=\"/support/article/settings-media-screen/\">Settings Media Screen</a> describes the location and structure of the upload directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"library\">Library</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/support/article/media-library-screen/\">Media Library Screen</a> allows you add, edit, delete or view Media previously uploaded to your blog. Multiple Media objects can be selected for deletion. Search and filtering ability is also provided to allow you to find the desired Media.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"add-new-media\">Add New Media</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Media Add New Screen\">Media Add New Screen</a> allows you to upload new media to later use with posts and pages. A drag and drop Uploader is provided and the ability to use a Browser Uploader button is also supplied.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"edit-media\">Edit Media</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Edit Media\">Edit Media</a> page allows you to edit the information (title, caption, alt text, etc.) of media files uploaded to your site. This page does not appear as a link in the main Dashboard navigation, but is reached by clicking on the Edit link in the <a href=\"/support/article/media-library-screen/\">Media Library Screen</a> that appears when you hover over each item, or when uploading media for the first time on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Media Add New Screen\">Media Add New Screen</a> once your upload has completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pages-your-static-content\">Pages &#8211; Your Static Content </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"/support/article/glossary/#page\">Page</a> is another tool to add content to a WordPress site and is often used to present &#8220;static&#8221; information about the site; Pages are typically &#8220;timeless&#8221; in nature. A good example of a Page is the information contained in &#8220;About&#8221; or &#8220;Contact&#8221; Pages. A Page should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called Posts, nor should a WordPress Page be confused with the word &#8220;page&#8221; referring to any web page or HTML document on the Web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology, and as such, are not displayed with the rest of your Posts, but are displayed individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"all-pages\">All Pages</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/support/article/pages-screen/\">All Pages Screen</a> provides the necessary tools to edit, delete or view existing Pages. On this Screen you can select the Page to edit, delete or view. Multiple Pages can be selected for deletion and for editing. A powerful bulk edit tool allows certain fields to be edited for a whole group of Pages. A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Page. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Pages you want to edit or delete.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"add-new-page\">Add New Page</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"/support/article/pages-add-new-screen/\">Add New Page Screen</a> allows you to create new Pages. Also see the <a href=\"/support/article/pages/\">Pages article</a> for an in depth discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"comments-reader-feedback\">Comments &#8211; Reader Feedback </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments are a feature of blogs which allow readers to respond to Posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comments-screen/\">Comments Screen</a> you can edit and delete as well as mark comments as spam. Comments that are awaiting moderation can be marked as approved or previously approved comments can be unapproved. Multiple comments can be selected and approved, marked as spam, unapproved, or deleted. A section at the top of the Comments Screen displays the number of comments awaiting moderation and the number of approved comments. A search box allows you to find specific comments</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog\">Appearance &#8211; Change the Look of your Blog </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress allows you to easily style your site by either installing and activating new Themes or customizing existing Themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips</strong>: From Theme Customizer launched by Appearance &gt; Customize, you can customize all other options such as Theme, Widgets, Menus and Header.
