One of two methods are available to deactivate all plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use <a href=\"/support/article/phpmyadmin/\">phpMyAdmin</a> to deactivate all plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In the table wp_options, under the <em>option_name</em> column (field) find the <em>active_plugins</em> row</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Change the <em>option_value</em> field to: <strong>a:0:{}</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Or reset your plugins folder via <a href=\"/support/article/ftp-clients/\">FTP</a> or the file manager provided in your host&#8217;s control panel. This method preserves plugin options but requires plugins be manually reactivated.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Via FTP or your host&#8217;s file manager, navigate to the wp-contents folder (directory)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Via FTP or your host&#8217;s file manager, rename the folder &#8220;plugins&#8221; to &#8220;plugins.hold&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Login to your WordPress administration plugins page (/wp-admin/plugins.php) &#8211; this will disable any plugin that is &#8220;missing&#8221;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Via FTP or your host&#8217;s file manager, rename &#8220;plugins.hold&#8221; back to &#8220;plugins&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to clear the &#8220;Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance&#8221; message after doing automatic upgrade?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the automatic upgrade WordPress places a file named <code>.maintenance</code> in the blog <strong>base</strong> folder (folder that contains the wp-admin folder). If that file exists, then vistors will see the message <strong>Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To stop that message from being displayed to vistors, just delete the <code>.maintenance</code> file. The automatic upgrade should be executed again, just in case it failed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An update was just released, so why does my blog not recognize the update is available?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When an update is released, notification of that release is displayed at the top administration screens saying <strong>WordPress x.x.x is available! Please update now.</strong> Not every blog will see that message at the same time. Your blog is programmed to check for updates every 12 hours, but the timing of that check is purely random. So if your blog just checked for updates minutes before an update was released, you won&#8217;t see the update message until your blog checks for updates 12 hours later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your blog to check right now for updates, you can delete the <strong>update_core</strong> option name record in your <em>wp_options</em> table. Note that plugins and themes each have their own check and update cycle, controlled by the records <strong>update_plugins</strong> and <strong>update_themes</strong>, in <em>wp_options</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relevant discussion thread:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/242485\">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/242485</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A core upgrade copies all the new files from the distribution over the old ones, so if you changed existing files in the WordPress default theme (e.g. <em>wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/style.css</em>), those changes got overwritten with the new version of that file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note, a core upgrade goes through a list of &#8220;old files&#8221;, as defined in <em>wp-admin/includes/update-core.php</em>, and deletes those files. Any files not on the list, and not in the distribution, are preserved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Remember, that before upgrades, whether automatic or manual, both the WordPress Files and database should be backed-up as explained in <a href=\"/support/article/wordpress-backups/\">WordPress Backups</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A better way to modify the default theme is by using a <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Child Themes\">child theme</a>. It&#8217;s a little more work to set up, but worth the effort because your customizations will be safe when the main theme is updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do you repair a MySQL database table?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every once in a while, it may be necessary to repair one or more MySQL database tables.

No account information is needed. This is not generally a problem if you are using a hosting service, but if you are using your own box and do not have an SMTP server, the mail will never send. If you are using a *NIX box, you should have either postfix or sendmail on your machine; you will just need to set them up (search the Internet for how-to\u2019s).

Grant access to&nbsp;<code>127.0.0.1</code>&nbsp;. Then in your&nbsp;<em>php.ini</em>file, set the&nbsp;<code>SMTP</code>&nbsp;setting to the same IP address. Also set&nbsp;<code>smtp_port</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>25</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ensure Proper Return Address is Used:</strong>&nbsp;By default, the WordPress mailer fills in the From: field with&nbsp;<em>wordpress@yourdomain.com</em>&nbsp;and the From: name as&nbsp;<em>WordPress</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is fine if this is a valid e-mail address. For example, if your real e-mail is&nbsp;<em>wordpress@yourdomain.com</em>, your host should pass the email on for delivery. It will probably send your mail as long as&nbsp;<em>yourdomain.com</em>&nbsp;is setup to send and receive mail, even if&nbsp;<em>wordpress</em>&nbsp;is not a valid mail box. But if you set you real email as the From: address and it\u2019s something like&nbsp;<em>wpgod@gmail.com</em>, the mail may not send because&nbsp;<em>gmail.com</em>&nbsp;is not a domain handled by the mail server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Treated as Spam:</strong>&nbsp;Your email message may have been routed to a spam folder or even worse, simply discarded as malicious. There are a couple measures you can use to convince recipient\u2019s mail servers that your message is legitimate and should be delivered as addressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SPF:</strong>&nbsp;(Sender Policy Framework) This is the most common anti-spam measure used. If you are on a hosted system, there is a good chance your host has set this up for the mail server you are using. Have WordPress email you and check the message headers for evidence that the message passed the SPF check. You can get a message sent by following the Forgot Password link on the login page. To keep your old password, do not follow the link in the message.<br>If your system email failed the SPF check, you can set up the credentials if you have access to your DNS records and your mail server\u2019s domain belongs to you. Check the return path of the email your system sent. If the mail server listed there has your domain name, you can set up SPF credentials. There are several how-tos on the Internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DKIM:</strong>&nbsp;(Domain Key Identified Mail) This system is also used. You can use both SPF and DKIM in the same message. Again, just as with SPF, you can check if your receiving mailserver verified your host\u2019s domain key by examining the mail header. There is a fair chance no signature key was provided, indicating your host chose to not use this protocol. Also as with SPF, if you can edit your DNS records and the mail server belongs to your domain, you can set up DKIM credentials yourself. Some how-tos exist if you search the Internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why can&#8217;t I see my posts?

This can also happen in other edited PHP files that are not theme templates, so please check the error message, as it will list the specific file name where the error occurred (see &#8220;Interpreting the Error Message&#8221; below). Replacing the faulty file with one from your most recent backup or one from a fresh WordPress download is your best bet, but if neither of those are an option, please follow the steps below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you cannot see anything does not mean that PHP sees the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Download the file mentioned in the error message via <a href=\"/support/article/ftp-clients/\">FTP</a> or the file manager provided in your host&#8217;s control panel.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open that file in a <a href=\"/support/article/glossary#text-editor\">plain text editor</a> (<strong>NOT</strong> Microsoft Word or similar.

In this scenario, line #42 of <code>wp-login.php</code> is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #34 of <code>wp-config.php</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the error message states: <code>Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/wp-admin/admin-header.php:8) in /path/wp-admin/post.php on line 569</code>, then the problem is at line #8 of <code>admin-header.php</code>, not line #569 of <code>post.php</code>.

Generally, this will be due to two or more plugins trying to use the same resources (for example, JQuery or other Java-based tools).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, it could be that there is a problem with your browser. A common resolution is to empty the browser&#8217;s cache.
