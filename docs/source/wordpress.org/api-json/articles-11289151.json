That means you can install, preview, delete Themes, activate, and update Themes.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to  produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a  weblog. These files are called <strong>template files</strong>.  A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the  underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image  files (*.jpg, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.php).  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Manage Themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Current Theme</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The current active Theme appears first in the upper left corner.

This is the easiest way to install a Theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit Administration &gt; Appearance &gt; <strong>Themes</strong>, click the Add New button. You can find additional themes for your site from the <a href=\"/themes/\">WordPress Theme Directory</a>.

This can be  used to install any Theme that is in a ZIP file. All the Themes in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/extend/themes/\">WordPress Theme Directory</a> can be installed using this method. Download the ZIP file. First find the Theme you want to install. Other sources of Themes can be used and  the key is to download the Theme ZIP file to your local computer.

If the Theme  is in ZIP file archive and extract the ZIP file contents to a folder on  your local computer. You may need to preserve the directory structure in  the archive when extracting these files. Follow the guidelines provided  by your Theme author.</li><li> Using an FTP client to access your host web server. If necessary create a directory to contain your Theme in the /wp-content/themes directory provided by WordPress. For example, a Theme named <strong>Test</strong> should be in /wp-content/themes/test. Your Theme may provide this directory as part of the archive.</li><li> Upload the Theme files to the new directory on your host server.</li><li> Visit Administration &gt; Appearance &gt; <strong>Themes</strong>,  if necessary navigate to the page displaying that Theme, then click the Activate link to make the Theme, the Current Theme.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Installing with cPanel</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If your host offers the cPanel control panel, and the Theme files are in a .zip or .gz archive follow these instructions.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li> Download the Theme ZIP file to your local machine.</li><li> In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your Themes folder. If you have  WordPress installed in it&#8217;s own folder called wordpress, you would  navigate to &#8220;public_html/wordpress/wp-content/themes&#8221; and if WordPress  is installed in your web-root folder you would navigate to  &#8220;public_html/wp-content/themes&#8221;.</li><li> Once you&#8217;ve navigated to the Themes folder in cPanel File Manager,  click on Upload file(s) and upload that ZIP file you saved in Step 1.</li><li>Once the ZIP file is uploaded, click on the ZIP file name in cPanel,  then in the panel to the right, click on Extract File Contents, and  that ZIP file will be uncompressed.</li><li> Visit Administration &gt; Appearance &gt; <strong>Themes</strong>, if necessary navigate to the page displaying that Theme, then click the Activate link to make the Theme, the Current Theme.</li></ol>\n",
