Yet, it is more than just a &#8220;skin&#8221;. Skinning your site implies that only the design is changed. WordPress Themes can provide much more control over the visual presentation of your content and other data on your WordPress site, as well as behavior of certain site&#8217;s elements while interacting with visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a website. These files are called <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/\">template files</a>. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (*.jpg, *.png, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom <a href=\"/support/article/pages/\">Pages</a>, as well as any necessary code files (*.php). For an introduction to template files, see <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/\">Template Files</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you write a lot about cheese and gadgets. Through the use of the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/\">WordPress Loop</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/\">template files</a>, you can customize your Cheese category posts to look different from your Gadgets category posts. With this powerful control over what different pages and categories look like on your site, you are limited only by your imagination. For information on how to create custom look for various templates in your theme, take a look at <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/\">Template Hierarchy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignnone\"><a href=\"https://wphierarchy.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/template-hierarchy.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10820867\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/template-hierarchy.png 2880w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/template-hierarchy-300x188.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/template-hierarchy-1024x640.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/template-hierarchy-768x480.png 768w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/template-hierarchy-1536x960.png 1536w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2018/10/template-hierarchy-2048x1280.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Template Hierarchy \u2013 the structure of WordPress theme files</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand this diagram, you can <a href=\"https://wphierarchy.com/\">interact with it</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"default-themes\">Default Themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress currently comes with twelve themes: the default <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/\">Twenty Twenty Two theme</a> (<a href=\"https://2022.wordpress.net/\">demo</a>), and the previous defaults <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/\">Twenty Twenty One theme</a> (<a href=\"https://2021.wordpress.net/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-twenty/\">Twenty Twenty</a> (<a href=\"http://2020.wordpress.net/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-nineteen/\">Twenty Nineteen</a> (<a href=\"http://2019.wordpress.net/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-seventeen/\">Twenty Seventeen</a> (<a href=\"http://2017.wordpress.net/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-sixteen/\">Twenty Sixteen</a> (<a href=\"https://twentysixteendemo.wordpress.com/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/twenty-fifteen/\">Twenty Fifteen</a> (<a href=\"https://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfourteen/\">Twenty Fourteen</a> (<a href=\"https://twentyfourteendemo.wordpress.com/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen/\">Twenty Thirteen</a> (<a href=\"https://twentythirteendemo.wordpress.com/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve/\">Twenty Twelve</a> (<a href=\"https://twentytwelvedemo.wordpress.com/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyeleven/\">Twenty Eleven</a> (<a href=\"https://twentyelevendemo.wordpress.com/\">demo</a>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyten/\">Twenty Ten</a> (<a href=\"https://twentytendemo.wordpress.com/\">demo</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Twenty Twenty Two theme is the first ever default <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/\">block theme</a>.

These themes are built for the newest features coming to WordPress that allow you to edit and customize all parts of your site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, you can add block themes in the same way you would any other theme. However, the Live Preview option is removed which means you will need to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/test-driving-wordpress/\">set up a test site</a>&nbsp;first to explore the theme before activating if you wish to preview it. You also will not have the option to use the Customizer since block themes rely on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/site-editor/\">Site Editor</a> to edit all parts of your site. In order to customize a block theme, you&#8217;ll need to activate it first. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/01/07/state-of-the-customizer-with-block-themes-in-wordpress-5-9/\">read more about this current experience here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"adding-new-themes-using-the-administration-screens\">Adding New Themes using the Administration Screens</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download any theme from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">WordPress Theme Directory</a> directly to your site by using the <strong>Add New</strong> option in the Appearance sub-menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Log in to the WordPress <a href=\"/support/article/administration-screens/\">Administration Screens</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the <a href=\"/support/article/administration-screens/#appearance-change-the-look-of-your-blog\">Appearance</a> screen, then <a href=\"/support/article/administration-screens/#themes\">Themes</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <strong>Add New</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Either use the <strong>Search</strong> or <strong>Filter options</strong> to locate a Theme you would like to use.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on the <strong>Preview</strong> link to preview the Theme or the <strong>Install</strong> link to upload the Theme to your site.
