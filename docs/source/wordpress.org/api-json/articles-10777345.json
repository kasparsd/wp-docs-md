When you activate comments on a <a href=\"/support/article/pages/\">Page</a> or post, WordPress inserts several text boxes after your content where users can submit their comments. Once you approve a comment, it appears underneath your content. Whether you want to customize how you receive comments or tweak how your site displays comments, WordPress provides a thorough set of options to build a community from the visitors to your site.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comment screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All comments on a WordPress website are displayed on the&nbsp;<strong>Comments</strong>&nbsp;dashboard in your WordPress admin area. It displays all comments by default</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1081\" height=\"604\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard.png?fit=1024%2C572&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The 'Comments' page in the admin dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-12717505\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard.png 1081w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard-300x168.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard-1024x572.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comments-dashboard-768x429.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1081px) 100vw, 1081px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can switch the view to see Pending, Approved, Spam, and Trash comments:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pending:</strong>&nbsp;comments submitted by your visitors, but won\u2019t be visible on your blog posts unless you approve them.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Approved:</strong>&nbsp;comments published and are publicly visible on your blog posts by all your website visitors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Spam</strong>:&nbsp;comments flagged as possibly unwanted or irrelevant, and aren\u2019t visible to your site visitors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trash</strong>:&nbsp;comments marked as unwanted and will be automatically deleted for good after 30 days.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving your mouse over to a comment will display the action links for it. You can approve a comment to make it visible to all your site visitors, or unapprove it to put it in pending status again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also reply to comments. By replying to a specific comment, your reply will appear right under that comment. This is called \u201cthreaded\u201d or \u201cnested\u201d comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also choose to edit anyone\u2019s comments on your own site. The&nbsp;<strong>Quick Edit</strong>&nbsp;option opens a text area so you can edit the comment without reloading the page.&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>, on the other hand, gives you more options to edit the name, user email, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a visitor submits his or her comment, WordPress follows your preferences and either hold the comment for your approval or posts it immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you see a comment marked as spam that\u2019s actually a real comment, then you can mark it as&nbsp;<strong>Not Spam</strong>&nbsp;by hovering your mouse over it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comments in the trash section are comments that have been deleted by you. Any comment in the trash can be restored by clicking on&nbsp;<strong>Restore</strong>. Comments in trash remain there for 30 days after this time WordPress deletes them permanently.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discussion settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you enable comments on posts or <a href=\"/support/article/pages/\">Pages</a>, reviewing the options under <a href=\"/support/article/settings-general-screen/\">Settings</a>  &gt; <a href=\"/support/article/settings-discussion-screen/\">Discussion</a> can help make your life as a moderator easier. Use these settings to restrict comments and reduce the amount of spam you receive.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notification</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"869\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings.png\" alt=\"The 'Discussion Settings' section of the 'Settings' page in the admin dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-12723227\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings.png 869w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings-300x72.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/default-post-settings-768x186.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you link another site post on your site, <strong>Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the post</strong> will enable your site to notify the website owners that you have linked to them.

You can set how many comments you see per Page and if the oldest or newest comments are displayed first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Comments should be displayed with the _____ comments at the top of each Page</strong> will place newer or older comments at the top of each page.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"862\" height=\"195\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration.png\" alt=\"Email and comment options on the 'Settings' page in the admin dashboard\" class=\"wp-image-12723283\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration.png 862w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration-300x68.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2020/04/comment-administration-768x174.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comment administration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Email me whenever \u2026 Anyone posts a comment</strong> and/or <strong>A comment is held for moderation</strong> will help you stay up to date on your comments.

As a result, many spam comments contain multiple links. Setting this option to hold all comments that contain 2 or more links will help catch more spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can experiment with <strong>Comment Moderation and Comment Blacklist</strong> to catch spam that contains certain words or is posted from a particular IP address. Comments caught through blacklisting are not deleted but instead <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comment-moderation/\">moved to your spam folder</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because spam is pervasive on the Web, some of the comments you receive will most likely be spam. However, WordPress developers and administrators have already developed a number of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-working-with-wordpress/#what-can-i-do-to-stop-comment-spam\">successful strategies to help you prevent spam comments</a> from appearing on your site. In addition to experimenting with different options in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-general-screen/\">Settings</a> &gt;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-discussion-screen/\"> Discussion</a>, you can install a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">WordPress Plugin</a> like <a href=\"http://akismet.com/\">Akismet</a> or <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam\">make other changes</a> to help you keep spam comments under control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avatars</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The settings under &#8220;Avatars&#8221; control the images your site displays next to comments. For an introduction to Gravatars, read the WordPress Lesson about <a href=\"/support/article/how-to-use-gravatars/\"> How to Use Gravatars in WordPress</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enabling comments on your site</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have decided on your discussion options, you are ready to enable comments.
