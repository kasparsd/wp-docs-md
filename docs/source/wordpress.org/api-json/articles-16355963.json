        "rendered": "\n<p>The position settings in\u00a0<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/blocks/\">blocks</a> allow you to set how an element is positioned in your site. These settings can only be found in a few blocks when they are placed at the root of site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The position settings are available when you use the\u00a0<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-editor/\">block editor</a>. If you are new to the block editor,\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/working-with-blocks/\" target=\"_blank\">this guide</a>\u00a0will show you how to work with blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to access position settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To access the position settings, either add a Group, Row, or Stack block to the root of your content, meaning not placed within another block. In the block settings sidebar of the block you added, you will find the<strong> Position</strong> section as shown below. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Type of settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Sticky-positioning-horizontal-view-1-361x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-16356035\" width=\"271\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Sticky-positioning-horizontal-view-1-361x1024.png 361w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Sticky-positioning-horizontal-view-1-106x300.png 106w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Sticky-positioning-horizontal-view-1.png 492w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each supported block comes with two different position settings. Automatically, blocks will use the &#8220;Default&#8221; option. You can switch between these two options as you&#8217;d like. If you do not see these settings, it&#8217;s because the block either doesn&#8217;t support the positioning option or, if it&#8217;s one of the blocks listed under blocks that include these settings, the block is not placed in the root of your site, meaning not placed within another block. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Default</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the option chosen automatically. It allows a block to be positioned as it usually is in relation to other blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sticky</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This option allows you to keep top-level blocks fixed to the top of a page as visitors scroll. This matches the CSS property of the same name. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Blocks that include position settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a reminder, this setting will only show for the following blocks when that block is placed at the root of your site, meaning not placed within another block.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Group</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Row</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stack</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Demonstration </h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Making a Header Template Part sticky</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common use case for the sticky positioning option is having a header that sticks to the top of the page as a visitor scrolls. To accomplish this, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Open <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/list-view/\">List View</a> </strong>and select the Header Template Part block. Ensure this Header Template Part block is not placed within another block. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the three dot menu either in List View or the block toolbar and choose the option to <strong>Group</strong>. This will wrap the Header Template Part block in a Group block. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the Group block that was just created and <strong>open the Block Settings sidebar</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add a background color to the Group block under the Styles tab in the Block Settings. This ensures that when a visitor is scrolling, the items in the Header Template part aren&#8217;t interfering with the rest of the blocks on the page. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scroll down to the Position settings and choose <strong>Sticky</strong>. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2023/03/Sticky-positioning-for-a-header-template-part.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group changelog has-very-dark-gray-color has-very-light-gray-background-color has-text-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size\" id=\"changelog\">Changelog<strong> </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Created 2023-03-27</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n",
