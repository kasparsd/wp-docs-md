It is there you will configure certain  aspects of your network.   So first, edit the wp-config.php file and add the following line to the file: </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">define('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);</pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Considerations</strong>&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li> Giving WordPress Its Own Directory will not work in WordPress 3.0 with multisite enabled. It interferes with the member blog lookup.</li><li> You cannot create a network in the following cases:</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n &#8220;WordPress address (URL)&#8221; is different from &#8220;Site address (URL)&#8221;\n &#8220;WordPress address (URL)&#8221; is used IP address such as 127.0.0.1 or port number other than &#8216;:80&#8217;, &#8216;:443&#8217;.\n Use &#8216;localhost&#8217; instead of &#8216;127.0.0.1&#8217;, if on local computer.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Addresses of Sites in your Network</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary information in this section involves the decision to use  sub-domains or sub-directories for your sites.  This means each  additional site in your network will be created as a new virtual  sub-domain or sub-directory.  Please choose whether you would like sites  in your WordPress network to use sub-domains or sub-directories. <strong>You cannot change this later</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sub-domains</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check this radio button to utilize sub-domains for your sites.  Examples of sub-domains are <strong>site1.example.com</strong> and <strong>site2.example.com</strong>.   This features works by using wildcard subdomains.  You must have this  enabled in Apache, and you must also add a wildcard sub-domain to your  DNS records. Some hosts will not support this, so you may need to ask  your host before enabling this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sub-directories</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check this radio button to utilize sub-directories for your sites.  Examples of sub-directories are <strong>example.com/site1</strong> and <strong>example.com/site2</strong>.  Sub-directories work with mod_rewrite.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: If you wish to use fully qualified domains, you still need to  pick a format to start with. Then after verifying they work, use the Domain mapping plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alternative Messages</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sub-domain Install</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This messages displays if you are changing from a stand-alone  version of WordPress to the multisite version this will display.<br /><br /><em>Because your install is not new, the sites in your WordPress  network must use sub-domains. The main site in a sub-directory install  will need to use a modified permalink structure, potentially breaking  existing links.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sub-directory Install</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This messages displays if you are using localhost as a domain.<br /><br /><em>Because you are using <code>localhost</code>, the sites in your WordPress network must use sub-directories. Consider using <code>localhost.localdomain</code> if you wish to use sub-domains.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Network Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Server Address</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Internet address of your network will be <code>example.com</code>.  This information is filled in automatically.  Note:  if your existing URL has <strong>www</strong> such as <strong>www.example.com</strong> you will see this message: &#8220;<em>We recommend you change your siteurl to <code>example.com</code> before enabling the network feature. It will still be possible to visit your site using the <code>www</code> prefix with an address like <code>www.sample.com</code> but any links will not have the <code>www</code> prefix.</em>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Network Title</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would you like to call your network?  A suggested title is supplied but edit that to reflect the title you want to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Admin E-mail Address</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your email address.  A suggested email is supplied, but change as necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Install</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Click the <strong>Install</strong> button to start the network install.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Installation Warnings</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may receive a warning about wildcard subdomains.<br /><br /><strong>To use a subdomain configuration, you must have a  wildcard entry in your DNS. This usually means adding a * hostname  record pointing at your web server in your DNS configuration tool.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Warning! Wildcard DNS may not be configured correctly!</strong><br /><br /><strong>The installer attempted to contact a random hostname  (599af5.sample.com) on your domain. This resulted in an error message:  Couldn&#8217;t resolve host &#8216;599af5.sample.com&#8217; </strong><br /><strong>You can still use your site but any subdomain you create may not  be accessible. If you know your DNS is correct, ignore this message.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enabling the Network</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the Network install is completed this Screen displays with these directions. Follow the directions in the order presented to complete the process. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/?attachment_id=11181273\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1277\" height=\"925\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/tools-network-created.png?fit=1277%2C925&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11181273\" srcset=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/tools-network-created.png 1277w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/tools-network-created-300x217.png 300w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/tools-network-created-1024x742.png 1024w, https://wordpress.org/documentation/files/2019/02/tools-network-created-768x556.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1277px) 100vw, 1277px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caution We recommend you back up your existing wp-config.php and .htaccess files.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.
