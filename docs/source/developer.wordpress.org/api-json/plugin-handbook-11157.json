Several WordPress core features, such as checking for updates and publishing scheduled post, utilize WP-Cron. The &#8220;Cron&#8221; part of the name comes from the cron time-based task scheduling system that is available on UNIX systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP-Cron works by checking, on every page load, a list of scheduled tasks to see what needs to be run. Any tasks due to run will be called during that page load. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-wporg-notice is-info-notice\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-wporg-notice__icon\"></div>\n<div class=\"wp-block-wporg-notice__content\">WP-Cron does not run constantly as the system cron does; it is only triggered on page load.</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Scheduling errors could occur if you schedule a task for 2:00PM and no page loads\u00a0occur until 5:00PM.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why use WP-Cron</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>WordPress core and many plugins need a scheduling system to perform time-based tasks. However, many\u00a0hosting services are shared and do not provide\u00a0access to the system scheduler.</li><li>Using the WordPress API is a simpler method for setting scheduled tasks than going outside of WordPress to the system scheduler.</li><li>With the system scheduler, if the time passes and the task did not run, it will not be re-attempted. With WP-Cron, all scheduled tasks are put into a queue and will run at the next opportunity (meaning the next page load). So while you can&#8217;t be 100% sure <em>when</em> your task will run, you can be 100% sure that it will run <em>eventually</em>.</li></ul>\n",
