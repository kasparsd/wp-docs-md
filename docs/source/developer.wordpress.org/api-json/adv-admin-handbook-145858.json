The information below is directed specifically for Network Administrators. Other users should see\u00a0<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/\">Administration Screens</a>\u00a0for information on using WordPress.</p>\n<p>The Network Admin link is only visible after you\u00a0<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/create-network/\">Create A Network</a>. The menu will appear in the upper right of the menu bar, and is only visible to super admins. It has been moved to a separate location with the admin area, and is available from the admin area of any site, as long as you are logged in as the super admin user.</p>\n<p>When visiting Network Admin you will see the Dashboard screen. This looks similar to a site dashboard, with one additional widget, and the site specific widgets removed. The Right Now widget has quick links to the Create a Site and Create a User screens, as well as search boxes to quickly find sites and users.</p>\n<p>Each screen is accessed via the main navigation menu, presented in the boxes below. The links in those boxes will lead you to sections of this article describing those screens. From those sections, you can navigate to articles detailing more information about each screen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dashboard\">Dashboard</h3>\n<p>The Dashboard is information central and tells you about your network sites, provides news from the WordPress community, gives access to your plugins, and shows other WordPress news.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sites\">Sites</h3>\n<p>Use the\u00a0<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/articles/network-admin-sites/screen\">Network Admin Sites Screen</a>\u00a0to review and manage the various sites that are part of your network.

If another theme is chosen, the disabled theme will not appear in the site&#8217;s Appearance &gt; Themes screen. Themes can be enabled on a site by site basis by the network admin on the Edit Site screen you go to via the Edit action link on the Sites screen.</p>\n<p>To add new themes, refer to the\u00a0<a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Network_Admin_Themes_Screen#Add_New_Theme\">Add New Theme</a>\u00a0to understand the process of finding and installing new themes for your network.</p>\n<p>Use the Theme Editor to edit the various files that comprise your Themes.
