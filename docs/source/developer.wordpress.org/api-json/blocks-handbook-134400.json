        "rendered": "<h2>The Block Editor</h2>\n<p>The block editor\u2019s general layout uses a bar at the top, with content below.</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" height=\"3000\" width=\"3000\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/VWA_jMcIRw-3000x3000.png?resize=3000%2C3000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Editor Interface\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong>Toolbar</strong> contains document-level actions: Editor/Select modes, save status, global actions for undo/redo/insert, the settings toggle, and publish options.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Content Area</strong> contains the document itself.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Settings Sidebar</strong> contains additional settings for the document (tags, categories, schedule etc.) and for blocks in the \u201cBlock\u201d tab. A cog button in the toolbar hides the Settings Sidebar, allowing the user to enjoy a more immersive writing experience. On small screens, the sidebar is hidden by default.</p>\n<h2>The Block</h2>\n<p>The block itself is the most basic unit of the editor. Generally speaking, everything is a block. Users build posts and pages using blocks, mimicking the vertical flow of the underlying HTML markup.</p>\n<p>By surfacing each section of the document as a manipulatable block, we surface block-specific features contextually. This is inspired by desktop app conventions, and allows for a breadth of advanced features without weighing down the UI.</p>\n<p>A selected block shows a number of contextual actions:</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" height=\"3000\" width=\"3000\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/3tQqIncKPB-3000x3000.png?resize=3000%2C3000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Block Interface\" /></p>\n<p>The block interface has basic actions. The block editor aims for good, common defaults, so users should be able to create a complete document without actually needing the advanced actions in the Settings Sidebar.</p>\n<p><strong>The Block Toolbar</strong> highlights commonly-used actions. The <strong>Block Icon</strong> lives in the block toolbar, and contains high-level controls for the selected block. It primarily allows users to transform a block into another type of compatible block. Some blocks also use the block icon for users to choose from a set of alternate block styles.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Block Formatting</strong> options let users adjust block-level settings, and the <strong>Inline Formatting</strong> options allow adjustments to elements inside the block. When a block is long, the block toolbar pins itself to the top of the screen as the user scrolls down the page.</p>\n<p>Blocks can be moved up and down via the <strong>Block Mover</strong> icons. Additional block actions are available via an ellipsis menu: deleting and duplicating blocks, as well as <strong>advanced actions</strong> like \u201cEdit as HTML\u201d and \u201cConvert to Reusable Block.\u201d</p>\n<p>An unselected block does not show the block toolbar or any other contextual controls. In effect, an unselected block is a preview of the content itself:</p>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" height=\"3000\" width=\"3000\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/DH9HZnEgwH-3000x3000.png?resize=3000%2C3000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unselected Block\" /></p>\n<p>Please note that selection and focus can be different. An image block can be selected while the focus is on the caption field.</p>\n<h2>Settings Sidebar</h2>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" height=\"3000\" width=\"3000\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/iAqrn6Gc8o-3000x3000.png?resize=3000%2C3000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Settings Sidebar\" /></p>\n<p>The sidebar has two tabs, Document and Block:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Document Tab</strong> shows metadata and settings for the post or page being edited.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Block Tab</strong> shows metadata and settings for the currently selected block.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each tab has sets of editable fields (<strong>Sidebar Sections</strong>) that users can toggle open or closed.</p>\n<p>If a block requires advanced configuration, those settings should live in the Settings Sidebar. Don\u2019t put anything in the sidebar block tab that is necessary for the basic operation of your block; your user might dismiss the sidebar for an immersive writing experience. Pick good defaults, and make important actions available in the block toolbar.</p>\n<p>Actions that could go in the block tab of the sidebar could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop cap, for text</li>\n<li>Number of columns for galleries</li>\n<li>Number of posts, or category, in the \u201cLatest Posts\u201d block</li>\n<li>Any configuration that you don\u2019t need access to in order to perform basic tasks</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Block Library</h2>\n<p><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" height=\"3000\" width=\"3000\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/cldup.com/7QoQIoLk-A-3000x3000.png?resize=3000%2C3000&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Block Library\" /></p>\n<p>The <strong>Block Library</strong> appears when someone inserts a block, whether via the toolbar, or contextually within the content area. Inside, blocks are organized into expandable sections. The block library\u2019s search bar auto-filters the list of blocks as the user types. Users can choose a block by selecting the <strong>Block Button</strong> or the <strong>Block Name</strong>.</p>\n",
