        "rendered": "\n<p>In order to better protect plugins from inadvertent releases, we&#8217;ve added a new <strong>opt-in</strong> feature for plugins: Release Confirmation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When enabled on a plugin, to release a new version of a plugin you&#8217;ll need to tag a new release in SVN as normal, and then confirm on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/releases/\">Release Management</a> dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to the Release Management dashboard is limited to plugin committers, and all actions require confirmation via a tokenised link which is emailed to you as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When WordPress.org detects a new version has been tagged in SVN, all committers are automatically sent an email notifying them that a new release is pending, who made it, and a link to the dashboard to confirm the release.<br>Plugin committers will also see a banner on the top of your WordPress.org plugins page directing you to the Release Management dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once confirmed, the release will proceed as usual and should update within a few minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Requirements</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Plugins are required to use tags for new versions, you cannot release your plugin from trunk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You must still update the <code>Stable Tag:</code> header in your trunk/readme.txt file.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Once released, alterations cannot be made to the tagged version. This includes changing the readme (for tested up to).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Committers must be able to receive emails directly, and not have it go to a shared inbox or support ticket system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Requiring double approval</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Release Confirmations are opt-in, but only requires a singular committer to confirm the release.<br>If a group would like to require multiple committers to approve a release, please contact the Plugins team with your request.</p>\n",
