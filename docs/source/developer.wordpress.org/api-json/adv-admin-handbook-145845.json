If this works, re-activate the plugins one by one until you find the problematic plugin(s). If you can&#8217;t get into your admin dashboard, try resetting the plugins folder by <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/ftp/\">SFTP/FTP</a> or phpMyAdmin (read <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-troubleshooting/\">How to deactivate all plugins when you can\u2019t log in to wp-admin</a> if you need help). Sometimes, an apparently inactive plugin can still cause problems. Also remember to deactivate any plugins in the <code>mu-plugins</code> folder. The easiest way is to rename that folder to <code>mu-plugins-old</code>.</li>\n<li>Switching to a Twenty-Something theme to rule out any theme-specific problems. If you can&#8217;t log in to change themes, you can remove the theme folders via <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/ftp/\">SFTP/FTP</a> so the only one is <code>twentytwentythree</code>. That will force your site to use it.</li>\n<li>If you can install plugins, install the plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/\">Health Check</a>. On the troubleshooting tab, you can click the button to disable all plugins and change the theme for you, while you&#8217;re still logged in, <strong>without affecting normal visitors to your site</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>2023-01-20: Content migrated from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/loopbacks/\">Loopbacks</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",
