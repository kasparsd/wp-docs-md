These files must follow template file standards set by the themes team. For Classic themes, additional standard template files are recommended to use. Learn more about the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/\">Organizing Theme Files</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"classic-themes-required-theme-files\">Classic Themes Required Theme Files</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>style.css<br></strong>Your theme&#8217;s main <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/including-css-javascript/\">stylesheet</a> file. This file will also include information about your theme, such as author name, version number, and plugin URL, in it&#8217;s header.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>index.php<br></strong>The main <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/\">template</a> file for your theme. This will be the template for the homepage on your site unless a static front page is specified. If you <em>only</em> include this template file, it must include all functionality of your theme. However, you can use as many relevant template files as you want in your theme.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>comments.php<br></strong></strong>The comment template which is included wherever comments are allowed. This file should provide support for threaded comments&nbsp;and&nbsp;trackbacks, and should style author comments differently then user comments. See the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/comments/\">Comments</a> page for more information.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>screenshot<br></strong>In the WordPress.org theme directory, the screenshot acts as a visual indicator of what your theme looks like. It is visible both in the web view and in the admin dashboard. The screenshot must not be bigger than 1200 x 900px.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>While these files are the only files required by the theme review team for acceptance into the WordPress.org theme directory, you may use other template&nbsp;files. Of course, any file mentioned in the tutorial in this handbook may be used in your theme.</p>\n",
