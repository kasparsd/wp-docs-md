You\u2019ll want to take care with that data and protect the privacy of your users and visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Privacy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org made several enhancements ahead of Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation. Following the launch of this work, we have made Privacy a permanent focus in core trac development, which will allow us to continue making enhancements on privacy and data protection outside specific legislation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what kind of issues might fall under the definition of &#8220;privacy&#8221;, and how do we define it? Although privacy requirements vary widely across countries, cultures, and legal systems, there are several general principles applicable across any situation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Consent and choice:</strong> giving users (and site visitors) choices and options over the uses of their data, and requiring clear, specific, and informed opt-in;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Purpose legitimacy and specification:</strong> only collect and use the personal data for the purpose it was intended for, and for which the user was clearly informed of in advance;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Collection limitation:</strong> only collect the user data which is needed; don\u2019t make extra copies of data or combine your data with data from other plugins if you can avoid it</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Data minimization:</strong> restrict the processing of data, as well as the number of people who have access to it, to the minimum uses and people necessary;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use, retention and disclosure limitation:</strong> delete data which is no longer needed, both in active use and in archives, by both the recipient and any third parties;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Accuracy and quality:</strong> ensure that the data collected and used is correct, relevant, and up-to-date, especially if inaccurate or poor data could adversely impact the user;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Openness, transparency and notice:</strong> inform users how their data is being collected, used, and shared, as well as any rights they have over those uses;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Individual participation and access:</strong> give users a means to access or download their data;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> documenting the uses of data, protecting it in transit and in use by third parties, and preventing misuse and breaches as much as is possible;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Information security:</strong> protecting data through appropriate technical and security measures;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Privacy compliance:</strong> ensuring that the work meets the privacy regulations of the location where it will be used to collect and process people\u2019s data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/45123.html\">ISO 29100/Privacy Framework standard</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not all of these principles will be applicable across all situations and uses, using them in the development process can help to ensure user trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Privacy By Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of these principles are espoused in the Privacy by Design framework, which states that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Privacy should be proactive, not reactive, and must anticipate privacy issues before they reach the user. Privacy must also be preventative, not remedial.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Privacy should be the default setting. The user should not have to take actions to secure their privacy, and consent for data sharing should not be assumed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Privacy should be built into design as a core function, not an add-on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Privacy should be positive sum: there should be no trade-off between privacy and security, privacy and safety, or privacy and service provision.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Privacy should offer end-to-end lifecycle protection through data minimization, minimal data retention, and regular deletion of data which is no longer required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The privacy standards used on your plugin (and service, if applicable) should be visible, transparent, open, documented and independently verifiable.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Privacy should be user-centric. People should be given options such as granular privacy choices, maximized privacy defaults, detailed privacy information notices, user-friendly options, and clear notification of changes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Food for Thought for Your Plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To help your plugin be ready, we recommend going through the following list of questions for every plugin that you make:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>How does your plugin handle personal data? Use wp_add_privacy_policy_content (link) to disclose to your users any of the following:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Does the plugin share personal data with third parties (e.g. to outside APIs/servers). If so, what data does it share with which third parties and do they have a published privacy policy you can provide a link to?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin collect personal data? If so, what data and where is it stored? Think about places like user data/meta, options, post meta, custom tables, files, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin use personal data collected by others? If so, what data? Does the plugin pass personal data to a SDK? What does that SDK do with the data?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin collect telemetry data, directly or indirectly? Loading an image from a third-party source on every install, for example, could indirectly log and track the usage data of all of your plugin installs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin enqueue Javascript, tracking pixels or embed iframes from a third party (third party JS, tracking pixels and iframes can collect visitor\u2019s data/actions, leave cookies, etc.)?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin store things in the browser? If so, where and what? Think about things like cookies, local storage, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If your plugin collects personal data\u2026\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Does it provide a personal data exporter?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does it provide a personal data eraser callback?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For what reasons (if any) does the plugin refuse to erase personal data? (e.g. order not yet completed, etc) &#8211; those should be disclosed as well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin use error logging? Does it avoid logging personal data if possible? Could you use things like wp_privacy_anonymize_data to minimize the personal data logged? How long are log entries kept? Who has access to them?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In wp-admin, what role/capabilities are required to access/see personal data? Are they sufficient?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What personal data is exposed on the front end of the site by the plugin? Does it appear to logged-in and logged-out users? Should it?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What personal data is exposed in REST API endpoints by the plugin? Does it appear to logged-in and logged-out users? What roles/capabilities are required to see it? Are those appropriate?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin properly remove/clean-up data, including especially personal data:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>During uninstall of the plugin?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When a related item is deleted (e.g. from the post meta or any post-referencing rows in another table)?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When a user is deleted (e.g. from any user referencing rows in a table)?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin provide controls to reduce the amount of personal data required?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the plugin share personal data with SDKs or APIs only when the SDK or API requires it, or is the plugin also sharing personal data that is optional?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the amount of personal data collected or shared by this plugin change when certain other plugins are also installed?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">External Resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Privacy Blog <a href=\"https://privacy.blog\">https://privacy.blog</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress.org Privacy Policy <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
