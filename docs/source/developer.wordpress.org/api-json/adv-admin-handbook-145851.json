This means if there are any issues you can restore your website. Complete instructions to make a backup can be found in the WordPress Backup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"one-click-upgrade\">One-click Upgrade</h3>\n<p>WordPress lets you update with the click of a button.  You can launch the update by clicking the link in the new version banner (if it\u2019s there) or by going to the Dashboard &gt; Updates screen. Once you are on the \u201cUpdate WordPress\u201d page, click the button \u201cUpdate Now\u201d to start the process off. You shouldn\u2019t need to do anything else and, once it\u2019s finished, you will be up-to-date.</p>\n<p>One-click updates work on most servers. If you have any problems, it is probably related to permissions issues on the filesystem.</p>\n<h4 id=\"hosting-services-tools\">Hosting Services Tools</h4>\n<p>You may have access to WP-Toolkit if your websites are hosted in cPanel (Look for &#8220;WordPress Management&#8221; in the left menu bar) or Plesk (Look for &#8220;WordPress&#8221; in the left menu bar). You can perform one-click update of your WordPress websites inside WP-Toolkit. You will also have the ability to configure automatic updates in WP-Toolkit.</p>\n<p>If your websites are hosted in a WP Squared server, you will see a notification and a button to perform one-click update of your WordPress website when a new update is available. Automatic update is enabled by default, and you have the ability to configure whether to enable or disable automatic updates in WP Squared.</p>\n<p><em>Hosting providers: If your tools are missing here, feel free to create a pull request in Github to add it.</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"manual-upgrade\">Manual Upgrade</h3>\n<h4 id=\"overview-of-the-upgrade-process\">Overview of the Upgrade Process</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/upgrading/#step-1-back-up-your-database\">Backup your database</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/upgrading/#step-2-back-up-all-your-wordpress-files\">Backup ALL your WordPress files</a> in your WordPress directory.

WordPress does support this process, and WordPress is extremely backwards compatible in this respect. That said, if you have a large site, the upgrade process may take longer than expected, in which case an incremental approach may help. Just remember to retain a backup of a working site so that you always have a fallback position.</em></p>\n<p>If you plan on upgrading across more than\u00a0<strong>two</strong>\u00a0major releases, you should consider upgrading incrementally to avoid potential conflicts and minimize the risks of database damage. Older versions of WordPress can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/\">release archive</a>.</p>\n<p>WordPress 3.7 introduced an easy to use one-button updater which will take you directly to Current Version. This update step is safe, and it is possible to one-click update from 3.7 to any later version.</p>\n<h5>Upgrading from WordPress 0.7 &#8211; 3.6 (by migration)</h5>\n<p>Goals:<br />\n&#8211; WordPress: upgrade to WordPress 6.2<br />\n&#8211; PHP: upgrade to PHP 7.4<br />\n&#8211; SQL: upgrade to MySQL 8.0 / MariaDB 10.11</p>\n<p>Losses:<br />\n&#8211; Content: none<br />\n&#8211; Plugins: all<br />\n&#8211; Themes: all</p>\n<p>These are the oldest versions of WordPress and the ones that have not been supported for years. In general, have to assume some losses, although not of the contents, but probably of some functionality on themes and plugins.</p>\n<p>Considering that the goal is to keep the contents and assuming the loss of the rest of the elements, there are some steps.</p>\n<p>As with any upgrade, the first thing to do is to make a backup copy. The best way to upgrade from WP &lt; 3.6 is to perform a content migration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a brand-new WordPress, without the database.</li>\n<li>Copy the old WordPress files from the &#8220;/wp-content/uploads/&#8221; content to the new one.</li>\n<li>Create a new database with the old database information. The best way is using &#8220;mysqldump&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Configure the wp-config.php with all the new data.</li>\n<li>Access the &#8220;/wp-admin/&#8221; page, and follow the upgrading process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With this way, WordPress will be able to maintain and update the contents in the database and be able to work with these contents in an updated version of WordPress.</p>\n<p>A WordPress with the default theme, and all the contents should now be available.</p>\n<p>Character Encoding commonly presents technical hiccups when restoring a database. It is possible that backup data is not encoded in UTF-8 and instead may be in an ISO or ASCII &#8220;deprecated&#8221; format.

They can range from PHP 5.2 (or even earlier) to PHP 5.5. That is why the main goal will be to go to a version that is still easy to get on many operating systems.</p>\n<p>The same will happen with the database. It is very likely that there is a MySQL 5.5 or earlier. Depending on whether want to continue with MySQL or move to MariaDB, choose which way to go and migrate the database to a MySQL 5.6 or MariaDB 10.0.</p>\n<p>Note that WP-CLI is not available for PHP versions lower than PHP 5.6.20, so this process still must be done somewhat manually.</p>\n<p>As with any upgrade, the first thing to do is to make a backup copy.</p>\n<p>Remove all themes that are not active, leaving only the main theme.

In your WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens\">Administration Screen</a>, deactivate all plugins that do not come with WordPress by default. Re-activate them one by one.</p>\n<p><strong>Made Custom Changes/Hacks?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have made changes to other WordPress files (&#8220;hacked&#8221; WordPress), you are supposed to keep track of your changes. You will have to transfer your edits into the new code. <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Versions\">WordPress Versions</a> lists the files that have changed in each release.</p>\n<p><strong>Resist Using Old Code</strong></p>\n<p>Upgrading gives you the newest and best code. Using your old code, no matter how much you have customised it, almost certainly will cause problems. The temptation just to use your old modified code will be great, but the chances of errors are much greater.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I Go Back to Old Versions</strong></p>\n<p>You can, but it is usually not recommended to rollback (revert) your current version to an older version. That is because newer versions often include security updates and a rollback may put your site at risk. Second, the change between the database structure between versions may cause complications in maintaining your site content, posts, comments, and plugins that are dependent upon the information stored in the database. If you are still intent on this, proceed at your own risk. <strong>Please note, that without a backup of your entire site and your database, made prior to your upgrade attempt, a successful rollback is near impossible.</strong> Delete all WordPress files except for <code>wp-config</code>. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/upgrade/ftp/filezilla/\">Upload</a> the files from your backup to your server and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/article/restoring-your-database-from-backup/\">restore your database backup</a>. Remember, you must have good backups for the rollback to work. For older WordPress versions, a rollback might not work.</p>\n<p><strong>Get More Help</strong></p>\n<p>If you get any errors following an upgrade, check <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/before-install/howto-install/#common-installation-problems\">Troubleshooting: Common Installation Problems</a>, <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Troubleshooting\">Troubleshooting</a>, and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/category/installation/\">Installation Category of Articles</a>. If you can&#8217;t find an answer, post a clear question on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forums/\">WordPress Support Forums</a>. You will be asked if you have used any old code. You&#8217;ll be told to change it then, so you may as well change it now \ud83d\ude42.</p>\n<h2>Configuring Automatic Background Updates</h2>\n<h3 id=\"update-types\">Update Types</h3>\n<p>Automatic background updates were introduced in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-3-7/\">WordPress 3.7</a> in an effort to promote better security, and to streamline the update experience overall. By default, automatic updates of WordPress are enabled on most sites. In special cases, plugins and themes may be automatically updated as well. Translation files are auto-updated by default.</p>\n<p>In WordPress, there are four types of automatic background updates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Core updates</li>\n<li>Plugin updates</li>\n<li>Theme updates</li>\n<li>Translation file updates</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"core-updates\">Core Updates</h4>\n<p>Core updates are subdivided into three types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Core development updates, known as the &#8220;bleeding edge&#8221;</li>\n<li>Minor core updates, such as maintenance and security releases</li>\n<li>Major core release updates</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before WordPress 5.6, by default, every site had automatic updates enabled for minor core releases and translation files only. Starting WordPress 5.6 and above, every new site has automatic enabled for both minor and major releases.</p>\n<p>Sites already running a development version also have automatic updates to further development versions enabled by default.</p>\n<h3 id=\"update-configuration\">Update Configuration</h3>\n<p>Automatic updates can be configured using one of two methods: defining constants in <code>wp-config.php</code>, or adding filters using a Plugin.</p>\n<h4 id=\"configuration-via-wp-config-php\">Configuration via wp-config.php</h4>\n<p>Using <code>wp-config.php</code>, automatic updates can be disabled completely, and core updates can be disabled or configured based on update type.</p>\n<h5 id=\"constant-to-disable-all-updates\">Constant to Disable All Updates</h5>\n<p>The core developers made a conscious decision to enable automatic updates for minor releases and translation files out of the box. Going forward, this will be one of the best ways to guarantee your site stays up to date and secure and, as such, disabling these updates is strongly discouraged.</p>\n<p>To completely disable all types of automatic updates, core or otherwise, add the following to your <code>wp-config.php</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'AUTOMATIC_UPDATER_DISABLED', true );\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"constant-to-configure-core-updates\">Constant to Configure Core Updates</h5>\n<p>To enable automatic updates for major releases or development purposes, the place to start is with the <code>WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE</code> constant. Defining this constant one of three ways allows you to blanket-enable, or blanket-disable several types of core updates at once.</p>\n<pre><code>define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', true );\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE</code> can be defined with one of three values, each producing a different behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Value of <code>true</code> \u2013 Development, minor, and major updates are all <strong>enabled</strong></li>\n<li>Value of <code>false</code> \u2013 Development, minor, and major updates are all <strong>disabled</strong></li>\n<li>Value of <code>'minor'</code> \u2013 Minor updates are <strong>enabled</strong>, development, and major updates are <strong>disabled</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that only sites already running a development version will receive development updates.</p>\n<p>For development sites, the default value of <code>WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE</code> is <code>true</code>. For other sites, the default value of <code>WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE</code> is <code>minor</code>.</p>\n<p>Starting WordPress 5.6, the default value of <code>WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE</code> for new WordPress installations is <code>true</code>. For new website, the default value of <code>WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE</code> is <code>minor</code>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"configuration-via-filters\">Configuration via Filters</h4>\n<p>Using filters allows for fine-tuned control of automatic updates.</p>\n<p>The best place to put these filters is in a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/plugins/mu-plugins/\">must-use plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>Do <em>not</em> add <code>add_filter()</code> calls directly in <code>wp-config.php</code>. WordPress isn&#8217;t fully loaded and can cause conflicts with other applications such as WP-CLI.</p>\n<h5 id=\"disabling-all-updates-via-filter\">Disabling All Updates Via Filter</h5>\n<p>You can also disable all automatic updates using the following filter:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'automatic_updater_disabled', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"core-updates-via-filter\">Core Updates via Filter</h5>\n<p>To enable all core-type updates only, use the following filter:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'auto_update_core', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>But let&#8217;s say rather than enabling or disabling all three types of core updates, you want to selectively enable or disable them. That&#8217;s where the <code>allow_dev_auto_core_updates</code>, <code>allow_minor_auto_core_updates</code>, and <code>allow_major_auto_core_updates</code> filters come in.</p>\n<p>There are two shorthand functions built into WordPress that will allow you to enable or disable specific types of core updates with single lines of code. They are <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/__return_true\">__return_true</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/__return_false\">__return_false</a>. Here are some example filters:</p>\n<p>To specifically <em>enable</em> them individually (for disabling, use <strong>false</strong> instead of <strong>true</strong>):</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'allow_dev_auto_core_updates', '__return_true' ); // Enable development updates\nadd_filter( 'allow_minor_auto_core_updates', '__return_true' ); // Enable minor updates\nadd_filter( 'allow_major_auto_core_updates', '__return_true' ); // Enable major updates\n</code></pre>\n<p>For Developers: To <em>enable</em> automatic updates even if a VCS folder (.git, .hg, .svn etc) was found in the WordPress directory or any of its parent directories:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'automatic_updates_is_vcs_checkout', '__return_false', 1 );\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"plugin-theme-updates-via-filter\">Plugin &amp; Theme Updates via Filter</h5>\n<p>By default, automatic background updates only happen for plugins and themes in special cases, as determined by the WordPress.org API response, which is controlled by the WordPress security team for patching critical vulnerabilities. To enable or disable updates in all cases, you can leverage the <code>auto_update_$type</code> filter, where <code>$type</code> would be replaced with &#8220;plugin&#8221; or &#8220;theme&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Automatic updates for All plugins</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'auto_update_plugin', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Automatic updates for All themes:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'auto_update_theme', '__return_true' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use <code>__return_false</code> instead of <code>__return_true</code> to specifically disable all plugin &amp; theme updates, even forced security pushes from the WordPress security team.</p>\n<p>The <code>auto_update_$type</code> filters also allow for more fine-grained control, as the specific item to updated is also passed into the filter. If you wanted to enable auto-updates for specific plugins only, then you could use code like this:</p>\n<pre><code>function auto_update_specific_plugins ( $update, $item ) {\n    // Array of plugin slugs to always auto-update\n    $plugins = array (\n        'akismet',\n        'buddypress',\n    );\n    if ( in_array( $item-&gt;slug, $plugins ) ) {\n         // Always update plugins in this array\n        return true;\n    } else {\n        // Else, use the normal API response to decide whether to update or not\n        return $update;\n    }\n}\nadd_filter( 'auto_update_plugin', 'auto_update_specific_plugins', 10, 2 );\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"translation-updates-via-filter\">Translation Updates via Filter</h5>\n<p>Automatic translation file updates are already enabled by default, the same as minor core updates.</p>\n<p>To disable translation file updates, use the following:</p>\n<pre><code>add_filter( 'auto_update_translation', '__return_false' );\n</code></pre>\n<h5 id=\"disable-emails-via-filter\">Disable Emails via Filter</h5>\n<pre><code>// Disable update emails\nadd_filter( 'auto_core_update_send_email', '__return_false' );\n</code></pre>\n<p>This filter can also be used to manipulate update emails according to email $type (success, fail, critical), update type object $core_update, or $result:</p>\n<pre><code>/* @param bool   $send        Whether to send the email. Default true.\n@param string $type        The type of email to send. Can be one of 'success', 'fail', 'critical'.\n@param object $core_update The update offer that was attempted.\n@param mixed  $result      The result for the core update. Can be WP_Error.\n*/\napply_filters( 'auto_core_update_send_email', true, $type, $core_update, $result );\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"resources\">Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>More examples at <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/25/the-definitive-guide-to-disabling-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7/\">https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/25/the-definitive-guide-to-disabling-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7/</a></li>\n<li>More information here: <a href=\"https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/120081/how-do-i-configure-automatic-updates-in-wordpress-3-7\">How Do I Configure Automatic Updates in WordPress 3.7?</a></li>\n<li>Info about wp-cli conflict: <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/1310\">https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/1310</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
