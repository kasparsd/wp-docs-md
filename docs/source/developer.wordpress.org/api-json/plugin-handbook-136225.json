This is akin to how a post on WordPress can only have one official post author.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Plugins With Under 10,000 Users</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re transferring your plugin to a new owner, there are two steps that must take place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, add the new user as a <strong>committer</strong> to the plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>go to <code>https://wordpress.org/plugins/YOURPLUGIN/advanced</code>&nbsp;and add their username in as a committer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>update the <code>readme.txt</code> to add their userID as an author</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, go to the Advanced tab and scroll down to the Danger Zone. There you will see a section for <strong>Transfer Your Plugin</strong>. Pick someone from the dropdown and click the button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are no other committers, the plugin will not be available to be transferred, so you must do that first.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2020/04/transfer.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"558\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2020/04/transfer.jpeg?resize=1024%2C558&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Transfer this plugin interface with a selector for the new owner and a &quot;Please transfer -Plugin Name-&quot; button\" class=\"wp-image-127845\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2020/04/transfer.jpeg?resize=1024%2C558&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2020/04/transfer.jpeg?resize=300%2C163&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2020/04/transfer.jpeg?resize=768%2C418&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/developer.wordpress.org/files/2020/04/transfer.jpeg?w=1384&amp;ssl=1 1384w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Plugins with OVER 10,000 Users (or are beta/featured)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to prevent abuse, larger plugins and those officially recognized as featured/beta are restricted from these changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To transfer a plugin in this case, you will need to email <code>plugins@wordpress.org</code> from the <strong>CURRENT</strong> owner&#8217;s email the following information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A <em>brief</em> explanation of the reason for the transfer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The user ID of the new owner</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If applicable, any changes to the status of being a featured/beta plugin</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Most requests are processed without issue, however should a plugin be determined to be critical to the WordPress.org project, or should there be reason to believe the request was invalid (i.e. not sent from the current owner&#8217;s email, or an email address positively connected back to them), it may be denied or delayed.</p>\n",
