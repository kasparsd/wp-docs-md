To report an issue with WordPress itself, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">follow the directions for reporting security vulnerabilities.</a></div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you find a plugin with a security issue, please\u00a0<strong>do not</strong> post about it publicly anywhere. Even if there&#8217;s a report filed on one of the official security tracking sites, bringing more awareness to the security issue tends to increase people being hacked, and rarely speeds up the fixing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To report a plugin, please email <code>plugins@wordpress.org</code>\u00a0with the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>a clear and concise description of the issue</li><li>a link to the specific plugin</li><li>whether or not you have validated the security issue yourself</li><li><strong>optional</strong> &#8211;  links to any public disclosures on 3rd party sites</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of serious exploits, please keep in mind responsible and reasonable disclosure. Every attempt to contact the developer directly should be made <em>before</em> you reported the plugin to us (though we understand this can be difficult &#8211; check in the source code of the plugin first, many developers list their emails). If you cannot contact them privately, please contact us directly and we&#8217;ll help out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most plugins are closed to prevent new downloads until the issue is resolved. As such,&nbsp;you may <em>not</em> be alerted of a fix until the plugin is updated. We also&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong> provide assistance with filing CVEs at this time, due to a lack of resources. You&#8217;re welcome to do so on your own, but we cannot help you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already posted the vulnerability in public and provided a link to your report, please do not&nbsp;delete it! We will&nbsp;pass it on directly to the developers of the plugin.</p>\n",
