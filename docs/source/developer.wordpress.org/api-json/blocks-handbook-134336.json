        "rendered": "<p>This guide will help you set up the right development environment to create blocks and other plugins that extend and modify the Block Editor in WordPress.</p>\n<p>A block development environment includes the tools you need on your computer to successfully develop for the Block Editor. The three essential requirements are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#code-editor\">Code editor</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#node-js-development-tools\">Node.js development tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#local-wordpress-environment\">Local WordPress environment (site)</a></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout-info\">\n    To contribute to the Gutenberg project itself, refer to the additional documentation in the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/getting-started-with-code-contribution\">code contribution guide</a>.\n</div>\n<h2>Code editor</h2>\n<p>A code editor is used to write code. You can use whichever editor you&#8217;re most comfortable with. The key is having a way to open, edit, and save text files.</p>\n<p>If you do not already have a preferred code editor, <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">Visual Studio Code</a> (VS Code) is a popular choice for JavaScript development among Core contributors. It works well across the three major platforms (Windows, Linux, and Mac), is open-source, and is actively maintained by Microsoft. VS Code also has a vibrant community providing plugins and extensions, including many for WordPress development.</p>\n<h2>Node.js development tools</h2>\n<p>Node.js (<code>node</code>) is an open-source runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript outside of the web browser. While Node.js is not required for all WordPress JavaScript development, it&#8217;s essential when working with modern JavaScript tools and developing for the Block Editor.</p>\n<p>Node.js and its accompanying development tools allow you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install and run WordPress packages needed for Block Editor development, such as <code>wp-scripts</code></li>\n<li>Setup local WordPress environments with <code>wp-env</code> and <code>wp-now</code></li>\n<li>Use the latest ECMAScript features and write code in ESNext</li>\n<li>Lint, format, and test JavaScript code</li>\n<li>Scaffold custom blocks with the <code>create-block</code> package</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The list goes on. While modern JavaScript development can be challenging, WordPress provides several tools, like <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-scripts/\"><code>wp-scripts</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-create-block/\"><code>create-block</code></a>, that streamline the process and are made possible by Node.js development tools.</p>\n<p><strong>The recommended Node.js version for block development is <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases\">Active LTS</a> (Long Term Support)</strong>. However, there are times when you need to use different versions. A Node.js version manager tool like <code>nvm</code> is strongly recommended and allows you to change your <code>node</code> version when required. You will also need Node Package Manager (<code>npm</code>) and the Node Package eXecute (<code>npx</code>) to work with some WordPress packages. Both are installed automatically with Node.js.</p>\n<p>To be able to use the Node.js tools and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages\">packages provided by WordPress</a> for block development, you&#8217;ll need to set a proper Node.js runtime environment on your machine. To learn more about how to do this, refer to the links below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/nodejs-development-environment/#node-js-installation-on-mac-and-linux-with-nvm\">Install Node.js for Mac and Linux</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/nodejs-development-environment/#node-js-installation-on-windows-and-others\">Install Node.js for Windows</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Local WordPress environment</h2>\n<p>A local WordPress environment (site) provides a controlled, efficient, and secure space for development, allowing you to build and test your code before deploying it to a production site. The same <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/about/requirements/\">requirements</a> for WordPress apply to local sites.</p>\n<p>In the broader WordPress community, many tools are available for setting up a local WordPress environment on your computer. The Block Editor Handbook covers <code>wp-env</code>, which is open-source and maintained by the WordPress project itself. It&#8217;s also the recommended tool for Gutenberg development.</p>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/devenv/get-started-with-wp-env/\">Get started with <code>wp-env</code></a> guide for setup instructions.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout-info\">\n    Throughout the Handbook, you may also see references to <code><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/playground-tools/tree/trunk/packages/wp-now\">wp-now</a></code>. This is a lightweight tool powered by <a>WordPress Playground</a> that streamlines setting up a simple local WordPress environment. While still experimental, this tool is great for quickly testing WordPress releases, plugins, and themes.\n</div>\n<p>This list is not exhaustive, but here are several additional options to choose from if you prefer not to use <code>wp-env</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://localwp.com/\">Local</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/\">WP Studio</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apachefriends.org/\">XAMPP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/\">MAMP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/\">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a> (VVV)</li>\n</ul>\n",
