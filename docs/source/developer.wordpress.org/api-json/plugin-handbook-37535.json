In 2018 it was modified to rely on more pertinent data. Since WordPress updates major releases 2 to 3 times per year, and a maintained a plugin should be testing with the recent versions, this alert can be avoided by updating a plugin readme when new versions of WordPress is released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers are emailed before every major release of WordPress and asked to update this value. They&nbsp;<em>do not</em> need to push a new version, just <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-your-readme-txt-works/\">update the readme</a> and edit the value of `Tested up to:` to the latest version of WordPress.</p>\n",
