They are events where people get together to work on various areas of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">https://make.wordpress.org/</a> There are many teams that people can participate in, each with a different focus. <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/\">https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/getting-started/getting-started-at-a-contributor-day/\">https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/getting-started/getting-started-at-a-contributor-day/</a>.</span></span></span>! We appreciate you sharing your time with <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>WP-CLI<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>WP-CLI</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>WP-CLI is the Command Line Interface for WordPress, used to do administrative and development tasks in a programmatic way.

We\u2019re here to support you however we can.</p>\n<p>When you submit your pull request, add `Related https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/5985` so we can see all pull requests created during the day. We\u2019ll give these some special promotion in the next release notes.</p>\n<p>Your table leads for the day are: <a href=\"https://github.com/schlessera\">schlessera</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/BrianHenryIE\">BrianHenryIE</a></p>\n<p>A few seasoned WP-CLI contributors are also helping out: TBD</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>If you normally use WP-CLI on your web host or via Brew, you\u2019re most likely using the Phar executable. The Phar executable is the \u201cbuilt\u201d, single-file version of WP-CLI. It\u2019s compiled from a couple dozen repositories in the WP-CLI <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>GitHub<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>GitHub</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  <a href=\"https://github.com/\">https://github.com/</a></span></span></span> organization, so modifying WP-CLI requires working amongst those repositories.</p>\n<p>Before you can work on WP-CLI, you\u2019ll need to first make sure you have <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>PHP<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>PHP</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php\">https://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php</a>.</span></span></span> and a functioning <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>MySQL<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>MySQL</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>MySQL is a relational database management system.

Once those prerequisites are met, install the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli-dev\"><code>wp-cli-dev</code> development environment</a> to start contributing:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli-dev\ncd wp-cli-dev\ncomposer install\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>wp-cli-dev</code> installation process clones all of WP-CLI\u2019s repositories to your local machine. After it\u2019s complete, you\u2019ll be able to make changes in whichever repository you\u2019d like. However, you\u2019ll need to fork the repository and add it as a remote in order to push your feature branch.</p>\n<p>All WP-CLI pull requests are expected to have tests. See <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/contributions/pull-requests/#running-and-writing-tests\">running and writing tests</a> for a complete introduction.</p>\n<h2>Suggested Tickets</h2>\n<p>To help you be successful during Contributor Day, we curated a list of reasonably approachable and actionable issues. Feel free to comment directly on the issue if you plan to work on it.
