The project page is <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\">http://wp-cli.org/</a> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/\">https://make.wordpress.org/cli/</a></span></span></span>. It\u2019s because of you, and the community around you, that WP-CLI is such a great project.</p>\n<p><strong>Contributing isn\u2019t limited to just code.</strong> We encourage you to contribute in the way that best fits your abilities, by writing tutorials, giving a demo at your local <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>meetup<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>Meetup</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>All local/regional gatherings that are officially a part of the WordPress world but are not WordCamps are organized through <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\">https://www.meetup.com/</a>. A meetup is typically a chance for local WordPress users to get together and share new ideas and seek help from one another. Searching for \u2018WordPress\u2019 on meetup.com will help you find options in your area.</span></span></span>, helping other users with their support questions, or revising our documentation.</p>\n<p>Please take a moment to read these guidelines in depth. Following the guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the other contributors to the project. In turn, they\u2019ll do their best to reciprocate that respect when working with you, across timezones and around the world.</p>\n<p>Should you have any questions about contributing, please join the <code>#cli</code> channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">WordPress.org Slack</a>.</p>\n<h3>Reporting Security Issues</h3>\n<p>The WP-CLI team and WordPress community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.</p>\n<p>To report a security issue, please visit the <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">WordPress HackerOne</a> program.</p>\n<h3>Reporting a bug</h3>\n<p>Think you\u2019ve found a bug? We\u2019d love for you to help us get it fixed.</p>\n<p>Before you create a new issue, you should <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awp-cli+label%3Abug+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc&amp;type=issues\">search existing issues</a> to see if there\u2019s an existing resolution to it, or if it\u2019s already been fixed in a newer version of WP-CLI. You should also check our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/common-issues/\">documentation on common issues and their fixes</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve done a bit of searching and discovered there isn\u2019t an open or fixed issue for your bug, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/bug-reports/\">follow our guidelines for submitting a bug report</a> to make sure it gets addressed in a timely manner.</p>\n<h3>Creating a pull request</h3>\n<p>Want to contribute a new feature? WP-CLI is a mature project, and already chock-full of useful functionality. Please first <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/ideas/issues/new\">open an ideas issue to suggest new commands</a>, or open an issue in the appropriate repository to suggest enhancements to existing commands. Opening an issue before submitting a pull request helps us provide architectural and implementation guidance before you spend too much time on the code.</p>\n<p>New to the WP-CLI codebase? Check out <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/good-first-issues/\">issues labeled \u2018good-first-issue\u2019</a> for a place to start. These issues are specially earmarked for new contributors.</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve decided to commit the time to seeing your pull request through, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/pull-requests/\">follow our guidelines for creating a pull request</a> to make sure it\u2019s a pleasant experience. See \u201c<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/pull-requests/#setting-up\">Setting up</a>\u201d for details on making local modifications to WP-CLI. Keep in mind pull requests are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/pull-requests/#running-and-writing-tests\">expected to have tests</a> covering the scope of the change. Read through <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/code-review/\">our code review guidelines</a> for a better understanding of how your pull request will be evaluated.</p>\n<h3>Improving our documentation</h3>\n<p>Is documentation your strength? Take a look at the currently open <a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awp-cli+label%3Ascope%3Adocumentation+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc&amp;type=issues\">documentation issues</a> and see if you can tackle any of those.</p>\n<p>There are a couple different types of documentation currently part of WP-CLI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation for individual WP-CLI commands (anything underneath <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/\">developer.wordpress.org/commands</a>) is contained in the PHPDoc for each command. This means that to edit the documentation for a command, you will need to edit the file that actually provides the functionality for that command. The web documentation is generated from these files at the time of release, so you may not see your changes until the next release.</li>\n<li>Individual documentation pages (anything under <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/\">make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook</a>) can be edited by contributing to the <a href=\"https://github.com/wp-cli/handbook/\">handbook repository on GitHub</a>.
